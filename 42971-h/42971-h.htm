<h3 class="vspace">I. AN INTRODUCTION TO MACAULAY<br />

<span class="smaller">(1800&ndash;1859)</span></h3>

<p>Before Thomas Babington Macaulay was big enough to
hold a large volume he used to lie on the rug by the open fire,
with his book on the floor and a piece of bread and butter
in his hand. Apparently the three-year-old boy was as fond
of reading as of eating, and even at this time he showed that
he was no mere bookworm by sharing with the maid what he
had learned from "a volume as big as himself." He never
tired of telling the stories that he read, and as he easily
remembered the words of the book he rapidly acquired a
somewhat astonishing vocabulary for a boy of his years. One
afternoon when the little fellow, then aged four, was visiting,
a servant spilled some hot coffee on his legs. The hostess,
who was very sympathetic, soon afterward asked how he was
feeling. He looked up in her face and replied, "Thank you,
madam, the agony is abated." It was at this same period of
his infancy that he had a little plot of ground of his own,
marked out by a row of oyster shells, which a maid one day
threw away as rubbish. "He went straight to the drawing-room,
where his mother was entertaining some visitors, walked into
the circle, and said, very solemnly, 'Cursed be Sally; for it is
written, Cursed is he that removeth his neighbor's <span class="locked">landmark.'"<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>

<p>As these incidents indicate, the youngster was precocious.
When he was seven, his mother writes, he wrote a compendium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span>
of universal history, and "really contrived to give a tolerably
connected view of the leading events from the Creation to
the present time, filling about a quire of paper." Yet,
fond as he was of reading, he was "as playful as a kitten."
Although he made wonderful progress in all branches of his
education, he had to be driven to school. Again and again
his entreaty to be allowed to stay at home met his mother's
"No, Tom, if it rains cats and dogs, you shall go." The boy
thought he was too busy with his literary activities to waste
time in school; but the father and mother looked upon his
productions merely as schoolboy amusements. He was to be
treated like other boys, and no suspicion was to come to him,
if they could help it, that he was superior to other children.</p>

<p>The wise parents had set themselves no easy task in their
determination to pay little attention to the unusual gifts of
this lad. One afternoon, when a child, he went with his father
to make a social call, and found on the table the <i class="pub">Lay of the
Last Minstrel</i>, which he had never before seen. While the
others talked he quietly read, and on reaching home recited
as many stanzas as his mother had the patience or the strength
to hear. Clearly a boy who had read incessantly from the
time he was three years old, who committed to memory as
rapidly as most boys read, and who was eager to declaim
poetry by the hour, or to tell interminable stories of his own,
would attract somebody's attention. Fortunately for all concerned
the lady who was particularly interested in him, and
who had him at her house for weeks at a time, Mrs. Hannah
More, encouraged without spoiling him, and rewarded him by
buying books to increase his library. When he was six or
eight years old, she gave him a small sum with which to lay
"a corner-stone" for his library, and a year or two afterward
she wrote that he was entitled to another book: "What say
you to a little good prose? Johnson's 'Hebrides,' or Walton's
'Lives,' unless you would like a neat edition of 'Cowper's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span>
Poems,' or 'Paradise Lost,' for your own eating?" Whether
he began at once to eat Milton's great epic we are not told,
but at a later period he said that "if by some miracle of
vandalism all copies of 'Paradise Lost' and 'The Pilgrim's
Progress' were destroyed off the face of the earth, he would
undertake to reproduce them both from <span class="locked">recollection."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span></p>

<p>Prodigy though he was, Thomas was more than a reader
and reciter of books. Much as he cared for them he cared
more for his home,&mdash;that simple, thrifty, comfortable home,&mdash;and
his three brothers and five sisters. His father, Zachary,
did a large business as an African merchant. This earnest,
precise, austere man was so anxious for his eldest son to have
a thoroughly trained mind that he expected a deliberation and
a maturity of judgment that are not natural to an impetuous
lad. The good-natured, open-hearted boy reasoned with him
and pleaded with him, and whether successful or not in persuading
his father, loved him just the same. The mother, with
all her love and ambition for him, took the utmost pains to
teach him to do thoroughly whatever he undertook, in order
that he might attain the perfect development of character that
comes alone from the most vigorous training. His sister, Lady
Trevelyan, writes: "His unruffled sweetness of temper, his
unfailing flow of spirits, his amusing talk, all made his presence
so delightful that his wishes and his tastes were our law. He
hated strangers and his notion of perfect happiness was to see
us all working round him while he read aloud a novel, and then
to walk all together on the Common, or, if it rained, to have a
frightfully noisy game of hide-and-seek." It was a habit in the
family to read aloud every evening from such writers as Shakspere,
Clarendon, Miss Edgeworth, Scott, and Crabbe; and, as
a standing dish, the <i class="pub">Quarterly</i> and the <i class="pub">Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>

<p>From this home, in which he was wisely loved, Thomas was
sent to a private school near Cambridge. Then his troubles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span>
began. The twelve-year-old boy longed for the one attraction
that would tempt him from his books&mdash;home life&mdash;and
months ahead he counted the days which must pass before
he could again see the home "which absence renders still
dearer." In August, 1813, he urged his mother for permission
to go home on his birthday, October 25: "If your approbation
of my request depends upon my advancing in study, I
will work like a cart-horse. If you should refuse it, you will
deprive me of the most pleasing illusion which I ever experienced
in my <span class="locked">life."<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> But the father shook his head and the
boy toiled on with his Greek and Latin. He wrote of learning
the Greek grammar by heart, he tried his hand at Latin verses,
and he read what he pleased, with a preference for prose fiction
and poetry.</p>

<p>When eighteen years old (in October, 1818), Macaulay
entered Trinity College, Cambridge. But for mathematics
he would have been made happy. He writes to his mother:
"Oh for words to express my abomination of that science, if a
name sacred to the useful and embellishing arts may be applied
to the perception and recollection of certain properties in numbers
and figures!... 'Discipline' of the mind! Say rather
starvation, confinement, torture, annihilation!"<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> There were
prizes, but Macaulay was not a prize winner. He was an excellent
declaimer and an excellent debater, and undoubtedly might
have won more honors had he been willing to work hard on
the subjects prescribed, whether he liked them or not. But he
was eager to avoid the sciences, and he was not content to be
a mere struggler for honors. He was sensible enough to enjoy
the companionships the place afforded. He knew something
of the value of choosing comrades after his own heart, who were
thoroughly genuine and sincere, natural and manly. Even if,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span>
as Mr. Morison says, the result of his college course was that
"those faculties which were naturally strong were made stronger,
and those which were naturally weak received little or no exercise,"
he wisely spent much time with a remarkable group of
young men, among whom Charles Austin was king. Of Austin,
John Stuart Mill says, "The impression he gave was that of
boundless strength, together with talents which, combined with
such apparent force of will and character, seemed capable of
dominating the world." And Trevelyan adds, "He certainly
was the only man who ever succeeded in dominating Macaulay."
Austin it was who turned Zachary Macaulay's eldest son from
a Tory into a Whig. The boy had always been interested in
the political discussions held in his father's house, a center of
consultation for suburban members of Parliament, and had
learned to look at public affairs with no thought of ambition
or jealous self-seeking. This sort of training, supplemented
by his discussions at college, where he soon became a vigorous
politician, developed a patriotic, disinterested man.</p>

<p>In the midst of his inexpressible delight in the freedom the
college course gave him to indulge his fondness for literature
and to spend his days and nights walking and talking with his
mates, he continued to remember his family with affection, and
did not neglect to write home. On March 25, 1821, he wrote
his mother: "I am sure that it is well worth while being sick
to be nursed by a mother. There is nothing which I remember
with such pleasure as the time when you nursed me at Aspenden.
The other night, when I lay on my sofa very ill and hypochondriac,
I was told that you were come! How well I remember
with what an ecstasy of joy I saw that face approaching me,
in the middle of people that did not care if I died that night,
except for the trouble of burying me! The sound of your
voice, the touch of your hand, are present to me now, and will
be, I trust in God, to my last <span class="locked">hour."<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span>
On the first of October, 1824, two years after he had received
the degree of Bachelor of Arts, he wrote his father that he was
that morning elected Fellow, and that the position would make
him almost independent financially for the next seven years.</p>

<p>In 1824, too, he made his first address before a public
assembly,&mdash;an antislavery address that probably gave Zachary
Macaulay the happiest half hour of his life, that called out a
"whirlwind of cheers" from the audience, and enthusiastic
commendation from the <i class="pub">Edinburgh Review</i>. The next year
Macaulay was asked to write for that famous periodical, then
at the height of its political, social, and literary power. He
contributed the essay on Milton and "like Lord Byron he
awoke one morning and found himself famous." The compliment
for which he cared most&mdash;"the only commendation
of his literary talent which even in the innermost domestic
circle he was ever known to repeat"&mdash;came from Jeffrey, the
editor, when he acknowledged the receipt of the manuscript:
"The more I think, the less I can conceive where you picked
up that style."</p>

<p>When Macaulay entered college, his father considered himself
worth at least a hundred thousand pounds; but soon afterward
he lost his money and the eldest son found the other
children looking to him for guidance and support. As if it
were the most natural thing in the world, he drew freely on
his income from the fellowship and his occasional contributions
to the <i class="pub">Edinburgh</i>. He was the sunshine of the home,
and apparently only those who knew him there got the best of
his brilliancy and wit.</p>

<p>In 1826 he was called to the bar, but he was becoming
more and more interested in public affairs and longed to be
in Parliament. In 1830 Lord Lansdowne, who had been
much impressed by Macaulay's articles on Mill, and by his
high moral and private character, gave him the opportunity
to represent Calne&mdash;"on the eve of the most momentous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">xv</a></span>
conflict," says Trevelyan, "that ever was fought out by speech
and vote within the walls of a <span class="locked">senate-house."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> When the Reform
Bill was introduced, the opposition laughed contemptuously at
the impossibility of disfranchising, wholly or in part, a hundred
and ten boroughs for the sake of securing a fair representation
of the United Kingdom in the House of Commons. Two days
later Macaulay made the first of his Reform speeches, and
"when he sat down, the Speaker sent for him, and told him
that, in all his prolonged experience, he had never seen the
House in such a state of excitement." That not only unsettled
the House of Commons but put an end to the question
whether he should give his time to law or to politics. During
the next three years he devoted himself to Parliament. Entering
with his whole soul into the thickest of the fight for reform,
he made a speech on the second reading of the Reform Bill
which no less a critic than Jeffrey said put him "clearly at the
head of the great speakers, if not the debaters, of the <span class="locked">House."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span></p>

<p>Naturally the social advantages of the position appealed to
Macaulay. He appreciated the freedom, the good fellowship,
the spirit of equality among the members. "For the space of
three seasons he dined out almost nightly"; and for a man
who at a time when his parliamentary fame was highest, was so
reduced that he sold the gold medals he had won at Cambridge,&mdash;though
"he was never for a moment in debt,"&mdash;it was
sometimes convenient to be a lion. Yet this "sitting up in
the House of Commons till three o'clock five days in the
week, and getting an indigestion at great dinners the remaining
two," would not have been the first choice of a man
whose greatest joy "in the midst of all this praise" was to
think of the pleasure which his success would give to his
father and his sisters.</p>

<p>In June, 1832, the bill which Macaulay had supported so
zealously and so eloquently at every stage of the fight, finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span>
became an act. As a reward the great orator was appointed a
commissioner of the Board of Control, which represented the
crown in its relations to the East Indian directors. He held
this commissionership only eighteen months, however, for as a
means of reducing expenses the Whig Government suppressed
it. It is to Macaulay's everlasting credit that he voted for this
economic measure at a time when his Trinity fellowship was
about to expire, and when the removal from office left him
penniless.</p>

<p>Impatient to choose the first Reformed Parliament, the great
cities were looking about that autumn for worthy representatives.
The Whigs of Leeds got Macaulay's promise to stand
for that town as soon as it became a parliamentary borough.
His attitude toward the electors whose votes meant bread to
him was as refreshing as it was striking. His frank opinions
they should have at all times, but pledges never. They should
choose their representative cautiously and then confide in him
liberally. Such independence was not relished in many quarters,
but Macaulay answered the remonstrants with even more
vigor: "It is not necessary to my happiness that I should
sit in Parliament; but it is necessary to my happiness that I
should possess, in Parliament or out of Parliament, the consciousness
of having done what is <span class="locked">right."<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span></p>

<p>His appointment as Secretary to the Board of Control was a
help financially, and his return to Parliament by Leeds proved
to be of very great assistance. Matters were going smoothly
when the Government introduced their Slavery Bill. To
Zachary Macaulay, who had always been a zealous abolitionist,
the measure was not satisfactory. To please him the son
opposed it. In order that he might be free to criticise the
bill, simply as a member of Parliament, he resigned his position
in the Cabinet, although both he and his father thought this
course of action would be fatal to his career. A son whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span>
devotion to his father leads him to such lengths is not always
so promptly rewarded as Macaulay was in this instance, for the
resignation was not accepted, the bill was amended, and the
Ministers were as friendly as ever.</p>

<p>Up to this time he had earned little money by his writing.
After giving his days to India and his nights to improving the
condition of the Treasury, he could get only snatches of time
for turning off the essays which we read with so much care.
With a family depending on him he now realized fully the need
not of riches but of a competence. He could live by his pen
or by office; but he could not think seriously of writing to
"relieve the emptiness of the pocket" rather than "the fullness
of the mind," and if he must earn this competence through
office, the sooner he was through with the business the better.
So it was largely for the sake of his aged father, his younger
brother, and his dearly loved sisters, that he accepted an
appointment as legal adviser to the Supreme Council of India.</p>

<p>He and his sister Hannah sailed for India in February, 1834.
He tells us that he read during the whole voyage: the <i class="pub">Iliad</i>
and <i class="pub">Odyssey</i>, Virgil, Horace, Cæsar's <i class="pub">Commentaries</i>, Bacon's
<i class="pub">De Augmentis</i>, Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto, Tasso, <i class="pub">Don Quixote</i>,
Gibbon's <i class="pub">Rome</i>, Mill's <i class="pub">India</i>, all the seventy volumes of Voltaire,
Sismondi's <i class="pub">History of France</i>, and the seven thick folios of the
<i class="pub">Biographia Britannica</i>. On his arrival he plunged into the
new work. Not satisfied with the immense amount already
assigned him, he saw two large opportunities to do more by
serving on two committees. As president of the Committee
of Public Instruction he substituted for Oriental learning the
introduction and promotion of European literature and science
among the natives; as president of the Law Commission
he took the initiative in framing the famous Penal Code,
the value of which must be judged from the facts that "hardly
any questions have arisen upon it which have had to be determined
by the courts, and that few and slight amendments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span>
have had to be made by the <span class="locked">Legislature."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> He worked
patiently, yet he longed to be back in England, and it was a great
relief when in 1838, his work done, his competence saved, he
was able to return. He was too late to see his father again, for
Zachary Macaulay had died while the son was on the way home.</p>

<p>In the fall he went to Italy with his mind full of associations
and traditions. His biographer says that every line of good
poetry which the fame or the beauty of this country had inspired
"rose almost involuntarily to his lips." On this occasion
he gave some of those geographical and topographical
touches to the <i class="pub">Lays of Ancient Rome</i> "which set his spirited
stanzas ringing in the ear of a traveller in Rome at every
turn." Much as he enjoyed Italy, he soon began to long for
his regular work, and the following February found him in
London again. In March he was unanimously elected to <i>the</i>
Club, and he was making the most of his leisure for books
when he felt it his duty to enter Parliament for Edinburgh.
"Office was never, within my memory, so little attractive," he
writes, "and therefore, I fear, I cannot, as a man of spirit,
flinch, if it is offered to me." Without any show of reluctance
he was made Secretary at War and given a seat in the Cabinet.
To this position the man who had begun life "without
rank, fortune, or private interest" had risen before his fortieth
birthday. On March 14, 1840, he wrote his intimate friend,
Mr. Ellis, a good account of his life at that <span class="locked">time.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span></p>

<p>"I have got through my estimates [for army expenses] with
flying colors; made a long speech of figures and details without
hesitation or mistake of any sort; stood catechising on all
sorts of questions; and got six millions of public money in
the course of an hour or two. I rather like the sort of work,
and I have some aptitude for it. I find business pretty nearly
enough to occupy all my time; and if I have a few minutes
to myself, I spend them with my sister and niece; so that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span>
except while I am dressing and undressing, I get no reading
at all. I do not know but that it is as well for me to live
thus for a time. I became too mere a bookworm in India,
and on my voyage home. Exercise, they say, assists digestion;
and it may be that some months of hard official and
Parliamentary work may make my studies more nourishing."</p>

<p>But the Queen's advisers did not have the confidence of
the country, there was a change of government, and Macaulay
lost his office. How the loss affected him we may gather
from a part of his letter to Mr. Napier, at that time the editor
of the <i class="pub">Edinburgh Review</i>.</p>

<p>"I can truly say that I have not, for many years, been so
happy as I am at present.... I am free. I am independent.
I am in Parliament, as honorably seated as man can be.
My family is comfortably off. I have leisure for literature,
yet I am not reduced to the necessity of writing for money.
If I had to choose a lot from all that there are in human life,
I am not sure that I should prefer any to that which has
fallen to me. I am sincerely and thoroughly <span class="locked">contented."<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span></p>

<p>Carlyle says that a biography should answer two questions:
(1) what and how produced was the effect of society on the
man; and (2) what and how produced was his effect on
<span class="locked">society.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> To the careful reader of Trevelyan's <i class="pub">Life</i> the words
just quoted from Macaulay will give a pretty fair notion of
what, up to this time, Macaulay had got from society. The
other question, what he gave to society, is perhaps best
answered in the account of the remaining years of his life.
In Parliament, in society, and in literary and political circles
throughout the country there was the feeling that he had
won the respect and good will of all, and that he was to do
something still greater. What this greater thing was to be was
the question that confronted Macaulay for the next few years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span>
Certainly it was not the publishing of his <i class="pub">Lays</i>, although
one hundred thousand copies of them were sold by the year
1875. Nor was it the collecting and reprinting of his <i class="pub">Essays</i>,
although they have given hundreds of thousands of minds a
taste for letters and a desire for knowledge. One could hardly
call it the delivery of those vehement and effective parliamentary
speeches with which he held his audience spellbound,
even if one of them did secure the passing of the Copyright
Bill in 1842 in practically its present form. But while attending
to these other matters, Macaulay had on his mind an
undertaking which was destined to satisfy, as far as he
carried it toward completion, the hopes of his most enthusiastic
admirers. In 1841 he had written to Napier, "I shall
not be satisfied unless I produce something which shall for a
few days supersede the last fashionable novel on the tables of
young <span class="locked">ladies."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> In order that he might give all his attention
to this one project he soon stopped writing for the <i class="pub">Edinburgh
Review</i>; he denied himself no little of the pleasure he had
been getting from society; he gave up more parliamentary
honors than most others could ever hope to win. At last, in
1848, he published the first volumes of a work that met with
a heartier welcome than the English-speaking world had given
to any historical work since the coming of Gibbon's <i class="pub">Decline
and Fall of the Roman Empire</i>. That these volumes of <i class="pub">The
History of England</i> were the result of a very different kind
of effort from that with which Macaulay had dashed off the
essays, may be inferred from a sentence of Thackeray's, which
Trevelyan says is no exaggeration: "He reads twenty books
to write a sentence; he travels a hundred miles to make a
line of <span class="locked">description."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> After all critics may say for or against
the <i class="pub">History</i>, it remains to note that Macaulay did what he
undertook: he wrote a history that is more readable than
most novels.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span>
In other ways we can trace his "effect on society." He was
chosen Lord Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1848.
Prince Albert tried, but in vain, to induce him to become
Professor of Modern History at Cambridge in 1849. He was
asked, but declined&mdash;urging the plea that he was not a debater&mdash;to
join the Cabinet in 1852. The same year the people of
Edinburgh, ashamed of their failure to reëlect him five years
before, chose him to represent them in Parliament. Meantime
he had been well and happy. In his journal for October 25, 1850,
he wrote: "My birthday. I am fifty. Well, I have had a happy
life. I do not know that anybody, whom I have seen close, has
had a happier. Some things I regret; but, on the whole, who
is better off? I have not children of my own, it is true; but I
have children whom I love as if they were my own, and who, I
believe, love me. I wish that the next ten years may be as
happy as the last ten. But I rather wish it than hope <span class="locked">it."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span></p>

<p>Macaulay may have surmised that the good health which
had been such an important factor in keeping him happy
would not last much longer. At any rate his last election to
the House of Commons was followed by an illness from which
he never fully recovered, but through which, for seven years,
"he maintained his industry, his courage, his patience, and
his benevolence." Occasionally he treated the House to a
"torrent of words," but he understood that he must husband
his powers for work on books. To protect himself from a
bookseller who advertised an edition of his speeches, he made
and published a selection of his own, many of which he had to
write from memory. Then he continued his work on the
<i class="pub">History</i>. Some of the time he had to "be resolute and work
doggedly," as Johnson said. "He almost gave up letter-writing;
he quite gave up society; and at last he had not
leisure even for his <span class="locked">diary."<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> Yet of this immense labor he
said, "It is the business and the pleasure of my life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span>
As a result of this steady toil the writer secured an enviable
influence abroad. He was made a member of several foreign
academies, and translations have turned the <i class="pub">History</i> into a
dozen tongues. At home, among the numerous honors, he
was presented with the degree of Doctor of Civil Law at
Oxford, and made a peer&mdash;Baron of Rothley. Naturally
before receiving this last honor he had withdrawn from Parliament,
and from 1856 to the end of his life he enjoyed a
retired home, with a fine garden. He had plenty of time to
cash the famous check for twenty thousand pounds which the
first edition of the <i class="pub">History</i> brought him, and to invest and
spend it as he pleased. On his fifty-seventh birthday he wrote
in his diary, "What is much more important to my happiness
than wealth, titles, and even fame, those whom I love are
well and happy, and very kind and affectionate to me."</p>

<p>One of the chief sources of his happiness, one to which he
was particularly indebted these last days, was his love of reading.
He could no longer read fourteen books of the <i class="pub">Odyssey</i>
at a stretch while out for a walk, but in the quiet of his library
he enjoyed the companionship of the author he happened to
be reading as perhaps few men could. He who could command
any society in London failed to find any that he preferred, at
breakfast or at dinner, to the company of Boswell; and it seems
natural and fitting that he should be found on that last December
day, in 1859, "in the library, seated in his easy-chair, and
dressed as usual, with his book on the table beside him."</p>

<p>Equally fitting is it that in Poet's Corner, Westminster
Abbey, the resting place of Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith, and
Addison, there should lie a stone with this inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Thomas Babington, Lord Macaulay,<br />
Born at Rothley Temple, Leicestershire,<br />
October 25th, 1800.<br />
Died at Holly Lodge, Campden Hill.<br />
December 28th, 1859.</span><br />
"His body is buried in peace,<br />
but his name liveth for evermore."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">For he left behind him a great and honorable name, and every
action of his life was "as clear and transparent as one of his
own sentences." His biography reveals the dutiful son, the
affectionate brother, the true friend, the honorable politician,
the practical legislator, the eloquent speaker, the brilliant
author. It shows unmistakably that greater than all his works
was the man.</p>

<h3>II. MACAULAY AND HIS LITERARY CONTEMPORARIES</h3>

<p>The very year in which the last volumes of Johnson's <i class="pub">Lives
of the Poets</i> were published, 1781, Burns began to do his best
work. In 1796 Burns died. In 1798, two years before
Macaulay was born, Wordsworth and Coleridge published the
first of the <i class="pub">Lyrical Ballads</i>, which included <i class="pub">The Rime of the
Ancient Mariner</i>. Like Burns, yet in a way entirely his own,
Wordsworth was the poet of Nature and of Man, and this little
volume was the beginning of much spontaneous poetry which
in the following years proved a refreshing change from the
polished couplets which had been in fashion. Instead of Pope
and Addison and Johnson, in whose time literary men cared
more for books than for social reforms, more for manner than
for matter, came Scott, Byron, Shelley, Coleridge, Landor, and
Southey with their irrepressible originality.</p>

<p>Before Macaulay's day Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, and
Smollett had each contributed something to the novel. During
his lifetime came practically all of the best work of Miss
Austen, Scott, Cooper, Lytton, Disraeli, Hawthorne, the Brontës,
Dickens, Thackeray, Mrs. Gaskell, Trollope, and Kingsley.
George Eliot's <i class="pub">Adam Bede</i> appeared the year he died.</p>

<p>Other prominent prose writers were Hallam, Grote, Milman,
Froude, Mill, Ruskin, and Carlyle. <i class="pub">In Memoriam</i> and Mrs.
Browning's <i class="pub">Sonnets from the Portuguese</i> were published in 1850,
and Browning's <i class="pub">The Ring and the Book</i> came out in 1868.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">xxiv</a></span>
As to Macaulay's relations with his literary contemporaries,
it must be understood that he gave practically his whole attention
to the times of which he read and wrote, and to the men
who made those times interesting. Scientists were making
important discoveries day by day, but his concern was not
with them, even at a time when Darwin was writing his
<i class="pub">Origin of Species</i>. It was not clear to him that philosophical
speculations like Carlyle's might do much to better the condition
of humanity. He finished Wordsworth's <i class="pub">Prelude</i> only
to be disgusted with "the old flimsy philosophy about the
effect of scenery on the mind" and "the endless wildernesses
of dull, flat, prosaic twaddle." Although he read an infinite
variety of contemporary literature he said he would not attempt
to dissect works of imagination. In 1838, when Napier wished
him to review Lockhart's <i class="pub">Life of Scott</i> for the <i class="pub">Edinburgh Review</i>,
he replied that he enjoyed many of Scott's performances as
keenly as anybody, but that many could criticise them far
better. He added: "Surely it would be desirable that some
person who knew Sir Walter, who had at least seen him and
spoken with him, should be charged with this article. Many
people are living who had a most intimate acquaintance with
him. I know no more of him than I know of Dryden or Addison,
and not a tenth part so much as I know of Swift, Cowper,
or <span class="locked">Johnson."<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> He turned instinctively to the old books, the
books that he had read again and again: to Homer, Aristophanes,
Horace, Herodotus, Addison, Swift, Fielding. There
was at least one writer of fiction in his time to whom he was
always loyal. On one occasion when he had been reading
Dickens and Pliny and Miss Austen at the same time, he declared
that <i class="pub">Northanger Abbey</i>, although "the work of a girl,"
was in his opinion "worth all Dickens and Pliny together."</p>

<p>What he did for humanity he did as a practical man of
affairs, at home alike in the Cabinet and in popular assemblies.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">xxv</a></span>
While Carlyle in the midst of his gloomy life was toiling
heroically to banish shams and to get at the True, the Real,
Macaulay, who was reasonably satisfied with the past and
the present, and hopeful of the future, was sifting from his
vast treasury of information about the past what he believed
to be significant in history and important in literature. He
had none of the feeling that Ruskin had, that it was his duty
to turn reformer, but what he did toward educating his readers
he did in the way he most enjoyed.</p>

<h3>III. THE STUDY OF MACAULAY</h3>

<p>Once for all it must be remembered that Macaulay had no
intention of being studied as a text-book, and we must deal
with him fairly. First we should read the <i class="pub">Life</i> through at a
sitting without consulting a note, just as we read an article in
the <i class="pub">Atlantic Monthly</i> or the <i class="pub">Encyclopædia Britannica</i>. We
should rush on with the "torrent of words" to the end to see
what it is all about, and to get an impression of the article as
a whole. As Johnson says: "Let him that is yet unacquainted
with the powers of Shakespeare, and who desires to feel the
highest pleasure that the drama can give, read every play from
the first scene to the last with utter negligence of all his commentators.
When his fancy is once on the wing, let it not
stoop at correction or explanation. When his attention is
strongly engaged let it disdain alike to turn aside to the name
of Theobald and of Pope. Let him read on through brightness
and obscurity, through integrity and corruption; let him
preserve his comprehension of the dialogue and his interest
in the fable. And when the pleasures of novelty have ceased
let him attempt exactness and read the commentators."</p>

<p>Macaulay attracts attention not only to what he says but
also to the way in which he says it. In examining his style
it will be a good plan to ask ourselves whether the writer ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">xxvi</a></span>
wanders from the subject, or whether every part of the <i class="pub">Life</i>
contributes something to the one subject under discussion.
Naturally we find ourselves making topics, such for example
as Johnson's Youth, His Father, At Oxford. A list of
these topics gives us a bird's-eye view of the whole field
and enables us to examine the composition more critically.
Has the writer arranged the topics in the natural order?
Does he give too much space to the treatment of any one
topic? Might any of them be omitted to advantage?</p>

<p>Having examined the larger divisions, we may profitably turn
our attention to the parts which constitute these divisions, the
paragraphs. First let us see whether he goes easily from one
paragraph to the next. For example, is the first sentence
of paragraph 2 a good connecting link with what precedes?
In looking through the <i class="pub">Life</i> for these links, we should make
up our minds whether they are studied or spontaneous.</p>

<p>Then let us test the unity of the paragraphs. Can each
paragraph be summed up in a single sentence? Does a combination
of the opening and the closing sentence ever serve
the purpose? Does one or the other of these ever answer
of itself? Has every sentence some bearing on the main
thought, or might some sentences be omitted as well as not?</p>

<p>It will be equally profitable, at this point, to test the coherence
of half a dozen paragraphs. Does each sentence lead
up naturally to the next? Can the order of sentences be
changed to advantage? When the sentences in a paragraph
hold together firmly, we should point out the cause; when
coherence is lacking, we should try to discover to what its
absence is due.</p>

<p>Then comes the question of emphasis. Let us see whether
we can find two or three paragraphs in which Macaulay succeeds
particularly well in emphasizing the main point. If we
find three, let us see whether he accomplishes his purpose in
the same way each time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">xxvii</a></span>
For those of us who are still willing to learn something from
Macaulay's style, it is worth while to study the sentences.
Selecting two or three of the most interesting paragraphs, we
may make the three tests: (1) Is each sentence a unit?
(2) Is the relation of every word to the adjoining words
absolutely clear? (3) Does the construction emphasize what
is important?</p>

<p>Then there is the vocabulary. Who does not enjoy the
feeling that he is enlarging his vocabulary? An easy way
of doing it is to read two or three times such a paragraph as
the nineteenth, and then, with the book closed, to write as
much of it as possible from memory. As it is not merely a
large vocabulary that we wish, but a well chosen one, we shall
do well to compare our version with Macaulay's and see in
how many cases his word is better than ours. Have we, for
example, equaled "winning affability," or "London mud," or
"inhospitable door"? Is his word more effective than ours
because it is more specific, or what is the reason?</p>

<p>Before taking farewell of the <i class="pub">Life of Johnson</i> there is another
use to which we may put the topics. We may use them as
tests of our knowledge of the essay. If we can write or talk
fully and definitely on each of the more important ones, we
are sure to carry much food for thought away with us. The
value of a review of this sort is evident from a glance at
the following topics: Literary Life in London in Johnson's
Time, Johnson's Love Affair, The Dictionary, The Turning
Point in Johnson's Life, The Rambler, Rasselas, The Idler,
His Shakspere, The Club [His Conversation], Boswell,
The Thrales, His Fleet Street Establishment, The Lives of
the Poets.</p>

<p>As we read Macaulay we should be particularly careful to
think for ourselves. Mr. Gladstone has said: "Wherever and
whenever read, he will be read with fascination, with delight,
with wonder. And with copious instruction too; but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">xxviii</a></span>
with copious reserve, with questioning scrutiny, with liberty
to reject, and with much exercise of that <span class="locked">liberty."<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<p>This means that we must follow him up, find out where he
got his information, see whether in his enthusiasm he has
exaggerated. Then, even if the critics do assure us that he
is not one of the deep thinkers, one of the very great writers,
we may go on committing his <i class="pub">Lays</i> to heart, studying his
<i class="pub">Essays</i>, and admiring those wonderfully faithful pictures in
his <i class="pub">History</i>. More than all else, as the years go by, we are
likely to find ourselves indebted to him for arousing interest,
for leading us to further reading.</p>

<h3>IV. MACAULAY ON JOHNSON</h3>

<p>Among the "hasty and imperfect articles" which Macaulay
wrote for the <i class="pub">Edinburgh Review</i> was one on Croker's Edition
of Boswell's Life of Johnson. It appeared in 1831 and gave
the writer a welcome opportunity to show the inaccuracy and
unreliability of Croker, one of his political opponents. Nearly
one half of his space he gave to criticising the editor, and that
part it seems wise to omit in this edition; for we care more
about Boswell and Johnson. Twenty-five years later, in 1856,
when Macaulay had ceased to write for reviews, but sent an
occasional article to the <i class="pub">Encyclopædia Britannica</i>, he wrote
what is generally called the <i class="pub">Life of Samuel Johnson</i>. The
publisher of the encyclopædia writes that it was entirely to
Macaulay's friendly feeling that he was "indebted for those
literary gems, which could not have been purchased with
money"; that "he made it a stipulation of his contributing
that remuneration should not be so much as mentioned."
The other articles referred to are those on Atterbury, Bunyan,
Goldsmith, and William Pitt. One writer calls them "perfect
models of artistic condensation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">xxix</a></span>
It is interesting to compare the later work with the earlier:
to see whether there is any evidence of improvement in
Macaulay's use of English, and whether he gives us a better
notion of Boswell and Johnson.</p>

<h3>V. REFERENCE BOOKS</h3>

<p>The book to which we naturally turn first to see whether
Macaulay knows his subject is Boswell's <i class="pub">Life of Johnson</i>; not
the edition in six volumes by Dr. George B. Hill, scholarly
as it is, but some such edition as Mr. Mowbray Morris's,
published by the Macmillan Company in one volume. When
we read Boswell the first time, to get his conception of his
hero, we do not care to loiter on every page for notes, interesting
and instructive as they may be after the first rapid reading.
This single volume is so cheap that no one need hesitate
to buy it; then he may mark it up as much as he pleases and
enjoy his own book. The conscientious student need not feel
obliged to read every word of every episode, but may feel perfectly
free to skip whatever does not appeal to him, perfectly
certain that before he has turned ten pages he will stumble on
something worth while.</p>

<p>The book which will do more than all others to illuminate
the life and character of Macaulay is <i class="pub">The Life and Letters of
Lord Macaulay</i>, written by his nephew, G. Otto Trevelyan.
Harper &amp; Brothers, the publishers, have bound the two
volumes in one which is so inexpensive that every school
library may easily afford it. Some critics think this <i class="pub">Life</i>
ranks with Boswell's <i class="pub">Johnson</i>. It certainly is one of the most
readable biographies in the English language. Other useful
books are numerous, but among them all Carlyle's essay in
reply to Macaulay's <i class="pub">Essay on Boswell's Life of Johnson</i> stands
out first.</p>

<h2 class="vspace"><a name="LIFE_OF_SAMUEL_JOHNSON" id="LIFE_OF_SAMUEL_JOHNSON">LIFE OF SAMUEL JOHNSON</a><br />

<span class="smaller">(<i>December, 1856</i>)</span></h2>

<p>
1. Samuel Johnson, one of the most eminent English
writers of the eighteenth century, was the son of Michael
Johnson, who was, at the beginning of that century, a magistrate
of Lichfield, and a bookseller of great note in the midland
counties. Michael's abilities and attainments seem to   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
have been considerable. He was so well acquainted with
the contents of the volumes which he exposed to sale, that the
country rectors of Staffordshire and Worcestershire thought
him an oracle on points of learning. Between him and the
clergy, indeed, there was a strong religious and political  <span class="linenum">10</span>
sympathy. He was a zealous churchman, and, though he had
qualified himself for municipal office by taking the oaths to
the sovereigns in possession, was to the last a Jacobite in heart.
At his house, a house which is still pointed out to every
traveller who visits Lichfield, Samuel was born on the 18th of  <span class="linenum">15</span>
September 1709. In the child, the physical, intellectual, and
moral peculiarities which afterwards distinguished the man were
plainly discernible; great muscular strength accompanied by
much awkwardness and many infirmities; great quickness of
parts, with a morbid propensity to sloth and procrastination;   <span class="linenum">20</span>
a kind and generous heart, with a gloomy and irritable temper.
He had inherited from his ancestors a scrofulous taint, which
it was beyond the power of medicine to remove. His parents
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>were weak enough to believe that the royal touch was a specific
for this malady. In his third year he was taken up to London,
inspected by the court surgeon, prayed over by the court
chaplains, and stroked and presented with a piece of gold by
Queen Anne. One of his earliest recollections was that of a
stately lady in a diamond stomacher and a long black hood.   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
Her hand was applied in vain. The boy's features, which
were originally noble and not irregular, were distorted by his
malady. His cheeks were deeply scarred. He lost for a time
the sight of one eye; and he saw but very imperfectly with
the other. But the force of his mind overcame every impediment.  <span class="linenum">10</span>
Indolent as he was, he acquired knowledge with such
ease and rapidity that at every school to which he was sent he
was soon the best scholar. From sixteen to eighteen he resided
at home, and was left to his own devices. He learned much at
this time, though his studies were without guidance and without  <span class="linenum">15</span>
plan. He ransacked his father's shelves, dipped into a multitude
of books, read what was interesting, and passed over what
was dull. An ordinary lad would have acquired little or no useful
knowledge in such a way: but much that was dull to ordinary
lads was interesting to Samuel. He read little Greek; for his  <span class="linenum">20</span>
proficiency in that language was not such that he could take
much pleasure in the masters of Attic poetry and eloquence.
But he had left school a good Latinist; and he soon acquired,
in the large and miscellaneous library of which he now had the
command, an extensive knowledge of Latin literature. That  <span class="linenum">25</span>
Augustan delicacy of taste which is the boast of the great public
schools of England he never possessed. But he was early
familiar with some classical writers who were quite unknown
to the best scholars in the sixth form at Eton. He was peculiarly
attracted by the works of the great restorers of learning.  <span class="linenum">30</span>
Once, while searching for some apples, he found a huge folio
volume of Petrarch's works. The name excited his curiosity;
and he eagerly devoured hundreds of pages. Indeed, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>diction and versification of his own Latin compositions show
that he had paid at least as much attention to modern copies
from the antique as to the original models.</p>

<p>2. While he was thus irregularly educating himself, his family
was sinking into hopeless poverty. Old Michael Johnson was
much better qualified to pore upon books, and to talk about  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
them, than to trade in them. His business declined; his debts
increased; it was with difficulty that the daily expenses of his
household were defrayed. It was out of his power to support
his son at either university; but a wealthy neighbour offered
assistance; and, in reliance on promises which proved to be of  <span class="linenum">10</span>
very little value, Samuel was entered at Pembroke College,
Oxford. When the young scholar presented himself to the
rulers of that society, they were amazed not more by his ungainly
figure and eccentric manners than by the quantity of extensive
and curious information which he had picked up during many   <span class="linenum">15</span>
months of desultory but not unprofitable study. On the first
day of his residence he surprised his teachers by quoting Macrobius;
and one of the most learned among them declared that
he had never known a freshman of equal attainments.</p>

<p>3. At Oxford, Johnson resided during about three years.   <span class="linenum">20</span>
He was poor, even to raggedness; and his appearance excited
a mirth and a pity which were equally intolerable to his haughty
spirit. He was driven from the quadrangle of Christ Church
by the sneering looks which the members of that aristocratical
society cast at the holes in his shoes. Some charitable person  <span class="linenum">25</span>
placed a new pair at his door; but he spurned them away in a
fury. Distress made him, not servile, but reckless and ungovernable.
No opulent gentleman commoner, panting for one-and-twenty,
could have treated the academical authorities with
more gross disrespect. The needy scholar was generally to be   <span class="linenum">30</span>
seen under the gate of Pembroke, a gate now adorned with
his effigy, haranguing a circle of lads, over whom, in spite of
his tattered gown and dirty linen, his wit and audacity gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>him an undisputed ascendency. In every mutiny against the
discipline of the college he was the ringleader. Much was
pardoned, however, to a youth so highly distinguished by abilities
and acquirements. He had early made himself known
by turning Pope's Messiah into Latin verse. The style and
rhythm, indeed, were not exactly Virgilian; but the translation  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
found many admirers, and was read with pleasure by
Pope himself.</p>

<p>4. The time drew near at which Johnson would, in the
ordinary course of things, have become a Bachelor of Arts:
but he was at the end of his resources. Those promises of  <span class="linenum">10</span>
support on which he had relied had not been kept. His
family could do nothing for him. His debts to Oxford tradesmen
were small indeed, yet larger than he could pay. In the
autumn of 1731, he was under the necessity of quitting the
university without a degree. In the following winter his father  <span class="linenum">15</span>
died. The old man left but a pittance; and of that pittance
almost the whole was appropriated to the support of his widow.
The property to which Samuel succeeded amounted to no more
than twenty pounds.</p>

<p>5. His life, during the thirty years which followed, was  <span class="linenum">20</span>
one hard struggle with poverty. The misery of that struggle
needed no aggravation, but was aggravated by the sufferings
of an unsound body and an unsound mind. Before the young
man left the university, his hereditary malady had broken forth
in a singularly cruel form. He had become an incurable  <span class="linenum">25</span>
hypochondriac. He said long after that he had been mad all
his life, or at least not perfectly sane; and, in truth, eccentricities
less strange than his have often been thought grounds
sufficient for absolving felons, and for setting aside wills. His
grimaces, his gestures, his mutterings, sometimes diverted and   <span class="linenum">30</span>
sometimes terrified people who did not know him. At a dinner
table he would, in a fit of absence, stoop down and twitch off
a lady's shoe. He would amaze a drawing-room by suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>ejaculating a clause of the Lord's Prayer. He would conceive
an unintelligible aversion to a particular alley, and perform a
great circuit rather than see the hateful place. He would set
his heart on touching every post in the streets through which he
walked. If by any chance he missed a post, he would go back
a hundred yards and repair the omission. Under the influence   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
of his disease, his senses became morbidly torpid, and his
imagination morbidly active. At one time he would stand poring
on the town clock without being able to tell the hour. At
another, he would distinctly hear his mother, who was many
miles off, calling him by his name. But this was not the   <span class="linenum">10</span>
worst. A deep melancholy took possession of him, and gave
a dark tinge to all his views of human nature and of human
destiny. Such wretchedness as he endured has driven many
men to shoot themselves or drown themselves. But he was
under no temptation to commit suicide. He was sick of life;   <span class="linenum">15</span>
but he was afraid of death; and he shuddered at every sight
or sound which reminded him of the inevitable hour. In religion
he found but little comfort during his long and frequent
fits of dejection; for his religion partook of his own character.
The light from heaven shone on him indeed, but not in a   <span class="linenum">20</span>
direct line, or with its own pure splendour. The rays had
to struggle through a disturbing medium; they reached him
refracted, dulled and discoloured by the thick gloom which
had settled on his soul; and, though they might be sufficiently
clear to guide him, were too dim to cheer him.   <span class="linenum">25</span></p>

<p>6. With such infirmities of body and mind, this celebrated
man was left, at two-and-twenty, to fight his way through the
world. He remained during about five years in the midland
counties. At Lichfield, his birthplace and his early home, he
had inherited some friends and acquired others. He was kindly  <span class="linenum">30</span>
noticed by Henry Hervey, a gay officer of noble family, who
happened to be quartered there. Gilbert Walmesley, registrar
of the ecclesiastical court of the diocese, a man of distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>parts, learning, and knowledge of the world, did
himself honour by patronising the young adventurer, whose
repulsive person, unpolished manners, and squalid garb moved
many of the petty aristocracy of the neighbourhood to laughter
or to disgust. At Lichfield, however, Johnson could find no
way of earning a livelihood. He became usher of a grammar  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
school in Leicestershire; he resided as a humble companion
in the house of a country gentleman; but a life of dependence
was insupportable to his haughty spirit. He repaired to Birmingham,
and there earned a few guineas by literary drudgery.
In that town he printed a translation, little noticed at the  <span class="linenum">10</span>
time, and long forgotten, of a Latin book about Abyssinia.
He then put forth proposals for publishing by subscription the
poems of Politian, with notes containing a history of modern
Latin verse: but subscriptions did not come in; and the volume
never appeared.   <span class="linenum">15</span></p>

<p>7. While leading this vagrant and miserable life, Johnson
fell in love. The object of his passion was Mrs. Elizabeth
Porter, a widow who had children as old as himself. To ordinary
spectators, the lady appeared to be a short, fat, coarse
woman, painted half an inch thick, dressed in gaudy colours,  <span class="linenum">20</span>
and fond of exhibiting provincial airs and graces which were
not exactly those of the Queensberrys and Lepels. To Johnson,
however, whose passions were strong, whose eyesight was
too weak to distinguish ceruse from natural bloom, and who
had seldom or never been in the same room with a woman of   <span class="linenum">25</span>
real fashion, his Titty, as he called her, was the most beautiful,
graceful, and accomplished of her sex. That his admiration
was unfeigned cannot be doubted; for she was as poor as
himself. She accepted, with a readiness which did her little
honour, the addresses of a suitor who might have been her  <span class="linenum">30</span>
son. The marriage, however, in spite of occasional wranglings,
proved happier than might have been expected. The lover
continued to be under the illusions of the wedding-day till the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>lady died in her sixty-fourth year. On her monument he
placed an inscription extolling the charms of her person and
of her manners; and when, long after her decease, he had
occasion to mention her, he exclaimed, with a tenderness half
ludicrous, half pathetic, "Pretty creature!"</p>

<p>8. His marriage made it necessary for him to exert himself  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
more strenuously than he had hitherto done. He took a
house in the neighbourhood of his native town, and advertised
for pupils. But eighteen months passed away; and only three
pupils came to his academy. Indeed, his appearance was so
strange, and his temper so violent, that his schoolroom must  <span class="linenum">10</span>
have resembled an ogre's den. Nor was the tawdry painted
grandmother whom he called his Titty well qualified to make
provision for the comfort of young gentlemen. David Garrick,
who was one of the pupils, used, many years later, to throw
the best company of London into convulsions of laughter by   <span class="linenum">15</span>
mimicking the endearments of this extraordinary pair.</p>

<p>9. At length Johnson, in the twenty-eighth year of his age,
determined to seek his fortune in the capital as a literary
adventurer. He set out with a few guineas, three acts of the
tragedy of Irene in manuscript, and two or three letters of  <span class="linenum">20</span>
introduction from his friend Walmesley.</p>

<p>10. Never, since literature became a calling in England, had
it been a less gainful calling than at the time when Johnson
took up his residence in London. In the preceding generation
a writer of eminent merit was sure to be munificently   <span class="linenum">25</span>
rewarded by the government. The least that he could expect
was a pension or a sinecure place; and, if he showed any aptitude
for politics, he might hope to be a member of parliament,
a lord of the treasury, an ambassador, a secretary of state. It
would be easy, on the other hand, to name several writers  <span class="linenum">30</span>
of the nineteenth century of whom the least successful has
received forty thousand pounds from the booksellers. But
Johnson entered on his vocation in the most dreary part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>the dreary interval which separated two ages of prosperity.
Literature had ceased to flourish under the patronage of the
great, and had not begun to flourish under the patronage of
the public. One man of letters, indeed, Pope, had acquired
by his pen what was then considered as a handsome fortune,
and lived on a footing of equality with nobles and ministers of  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
state. But this was a solitary exception. Even an author
whose reputation was established, and whose works were popular,
such an author as Thomson, whose Seasons were in every
library, such an author as Fielding, whose Pasquin had had a
greater run than any drama since The Beggar's Opera, was  <span class="linenum">10</span>
sometimes glad to obtain, by pawning his best coat, the means
of dining on tripe at a cookshop underground, where he could
wipe his hands, after his greasy meal, on the back of a Newfoundland
dog. It is easy, therefore, to imagine what humiliations
and privations must have awaited the novice who had  <span class="linenum">15</span>
still to earn a name. One of the publishers to whom Johnson
applied for employment measured with a scornful eye that
athletic though uncouth frame, and exclaimed, "You had
better get a porter's knot, and carry trunks." Nor was the
advice bad; for a porter was likely to be as plentifully fed,  <span class="linenum">20</span>
and as comfortably lodged, as a poet.</p>

<p>11. Some time appears to have elapsed before Johnson
was able to form any literary connection from which he could
expect more than bread for the day which was passing over
him. He never forgot the generosity with which Hervey, who  <span class="linenum">25</span>
was now residing in London, relieved his wants during this
time of trial. "Harry Hervey," said the old philosopher
many years later, "was a vicious man; but he was very
kind to me. If you call a dog Hervey I shall love him."
At Hervey's table Johnson sometimes enjoyed feasts which  <span class="linenum">30</span>
were made more agreeable by contrast. But in general he
dined, and thought that he dined well, on sixpenny worth
of meat, and a pennyworth of bread, at an alehouse near
Drury Lane.</p>

<p>12. The effect of the privations and sufferings which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
endured at this time was discernible to the last in his temper
and his deportment. His manners had never been courtly.
They now became almost savage. Being frequently under the
necessity of wearing shabby coats and dirty shirts, he became a   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
confirmed sloven. Being often very hungry when he sat down
to his meals, he contracted a habit of eating with ravenous
greediness. Even to the end of his life, and even at the tables
of the great, the sight of food affected him as it affects wild
beasts and birds of prey. His taste in cookery, formed in   <span class="linenum">10</span>
subterranean ordinaries and alamode beefshops, was far from
delicate. Whenever he was so fortunate as to have near him
a hare that had been kept too long, or a meat pie made with
rancid butter, he gorged himself with such violence that his
veins swelled, and the moisture broke out on his forehead.  <span class="linenum">15</span>
The affronts which his poverty emboldened stupid and low-minded
men to offer to him would have broken a mean spirit
into sycophancy, but made him rude even to ferocity. Unhappily
the insolence which, while it was defensive, was pardonable,
and in some sense respectable, accompanied him into  <span class="linenum">20</span>
societies where he was treated with courtesy and kindness. He
was repeatedly provoked into striking those who had taken
liberties with him. All the sufferers, however, were wise
enough to abstain from talking about their beatings, except
Osborne, the most rapacious and brutal of booksellers, who   <span class="linenum">25</span>
proclaimed everywhere that he had been knocked down by the
huge fellow whom he had hired to puff the Harleian Library.</p>

<p>13. About a year after Johnson had begun to reside in
London, he was fortunate enough to obtain regular employment
from Cave, an enterprising and intelligent bookseller, who  <span class="linenum">30</span>
was proprietor and editor of <i class="pub">The Gentleman's Magazine</i>. That
journal, just entering on the ninth year of its long existence,
was the only periodical work in the kingdom which then had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>what would now be called a large circulation. It was, indeed,
the chief source of parliamentary intelligence. It was not then
safe, even during a recess, to publish an account of the proceedings
of either House without some disguise. Cave, however,
ventured to entertain his readers with what he called
"Reports of the Debates of the Senate of Lilliput." France   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
was Blefuscu; London was Mildendo; pounds were sprugs; the
Duke of Newcastle was the Nardac Secretary of State; Lord
Hardwicke was the Hurgo Hickrad; and William Pulteney
was Wingul Pulnub. To write the speeches was, during several
years, the business of Johnson. He was generally furnished  <span class="linenum">10</span>
with notes, meagre indeed, and inaccurate, of what had been
said; but sometimes he had to find arguments and eloquence
both for the ministry and for the opposition. He was himself
a Tory, not from rational conviction&mdash;for his serious
opinion was that one form of government was just as good or   <span class="linenum">15</span>
as bad as another&mdash;but from mere passion, such as inflamed
the Capulets against the Montagues, or the Blues of the Roman
circus against the Greens. In his infancy he had heard so
much talk about the villanies of the Whigs, and the dangers
of the Church, that he had become a furious partisan when  <span class="linenum">20</span>
he could scarcely speak. Before he was three he had insisted
on being taken to hear Sacheverell preach at Lichfield Cathedral,
and had listened to the sermon with as much respect,
and probably with as much intelligence, as any Staffordshire
squire in the congregation. The work which had been begun  <span class="linenum">25</span>
in the nursery had been completed by the university. Oxford,
when Johnson resided there, was the most Jacobitical place
in England; and Pembroke was one of the most Jacobitical
colleges in Oxford. The prejudices which he brought up
to London were scarcely less absurd than those of his own   <span class="linenum">30</span>
Tom Tempest. Charles II. and James II. were two of the
best kings that ever reigned. Laud, a poor creature who
never did, said, or wrote anything indicating more than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>ordinary capacity of an old woman, was a prodigy of parts and
learning over whose tomb Art and Genius still continued to
weep. Hampden deserved no more honourable name than
that of "the zealot of rebellion." Even the ship money, condemned
not less decidedly by Falkland and Clarendon than by
the bitterest Roundheads, Johnson would not pronounce to  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
have been an unconstitutional impost. Under a government,
the mildest that had ever been known in the world&mdash;under a
government, which allowed to the people an unprecedented
liberty of speech and action&mdash;he fancied that he was a slave;
he assailed the ministry with obloquy which refuted itself, and   <span class="linenum">10</span>
regretted the lost freedom and happiness of those golden days
in which a writer who had taken but one-tenth part of the
license allowed to him would have been pilloried, mangled
with the shears, whipped at the cart's tail, and flung into a
noisome dungeon to die. He hated dissenters and stock-jobbers,   <span class="linenum">15</span>
the excise and the army, septennial parliaments, and
continental connections. He long had an aversion to the
Scotch, an aversion of which he could not remember the
commencement, but which, he owned, had probably originated in
his abhorrence of the conduct of the nation during the Great   <span class="linenum">20</span>
Rebellion. It is easy to guess in what manner debates on
great party questions were likely to be reported by a man
whose judgment was so much disordered by party spirit. A
show of fairness was indeed necessary to the prosperity of the
Magazine. But Johnson long afterwards owned that, though   <span class="linenum">25</span>
he had saved appearances, he had taken care that the Whig
dogs should not have the best of it; and, in fact, every passage
which has lived, every passage which bears the marks of
his higher faculties, is put into the mouth of some member
of the opposition.  <span class="linenum">30</span></p>

<p>14. A few weeks after Johnson had entered on these
obscure labours, he published a work which at once placed
him high among the writers of his age. It is probable that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>what he had suffered during his first year in London had often
reminded him of some parts of that noble poem in which
Juvenal had described the misery and degradation of a needy
man of letters, lodged among the pigeons' nests in the tottering
garrets which overhung the streets of Rome. Pope's
admirable imitations of Horace's Satires and Epistles had  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
recently appeared, were in every hand, and were by many
readers thought superior to the originals. What Pope had
done for Horace, Johnson aspired to do for Juvenal. The
enterprise was bold, and yet judicious. For between Johnson
and Juvenal there was much in common, much more certainly   <span class="linenum">10</span>
than between Pope and Horace.</p>

<p>15. Johnson's London appeared without his name in
May 1738. He received only ten guineas for this stately and
vigorous poem: but the sale was rapid, and the success complete.
A second edition was required within a week. Those   <span class="linenum">15</span>
small critics who are always desirous to lower established reputations
ran about proclaiming that the anonymous satirist
was superior to Pope in Pope's own peculiar department of
literature. It ought to be remembered, to the honour of Pope,
that he joined heartily in the applause with which the appearance   <span class="linenum">20</span>
of a rival genius was welcomed. He made inquiries about
the author of London. Such a man, he said, could not long
be concealed. The name was soon discovered; and Pope,
with great kindness, exerted himself to obtain an academical
degree and the mastership of a grammar school for the poor  <span class="linenum">25</span>
young poet. The attempt failed, and Johnson remained a
bookseller's hack.</p>

<p>16. It does not appear that these two men, the most
eminent writer of the generation which was going out, and
the most eminent writer of the generation which was coming  <span class="linenum">30</span>
in, ever saw each other. They lived in very different circles,
one surrounded by dukes and earls, the other by starving
pamphleteers and indexmakers. Among Johnson's associates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>at this time may be mentioned Boyse, who, when his shirts
were pledged, scrawled Latin verses sitting up in bed with his
arms through two holes in his blanket, who composed very
respectable sacred poetry when he was sober, and who was at
last run over by a hackney coach when he was drunk; Hoole,
surnamed the metaphysical tailor, who, instead of attending  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
to his measures, used to trace geometrical diagrams on the
board where he sate cross-legged; and the penitent impostor,
George Psalmanazar, who, after poring all day, in a humble
lodging, on the folios of Jewish rabbis and Christian fathers,
indulged himself at night with literary and theological  <span class="linenum">10</span>
conversation at an alehouse in the city. But the most remarkable
of the persons with whom at this time Johnson consorted
was Richard Savage, an earl's son, a shoemaker's apprentice,
who had seen life in all its forms, who had feasted among blue
ribands in Saint James's Square, and had lain with fifty pounds'  <span class="linenum">15</span>
weight of iron on his legs in the condemned ward of Newgate.
This man had, after many vicissitudes of fortune, sunk at last
into abject and hopeless poverty. His pen had failed him.
His patrons had been taken away by death, or estranged by
the riotous profusion with which he squandered their bounty,   <span class="linenum">20</span>
and the ungrateful insolence with which he rejected their
advice. He now lived by begging. He dined on venison
and champagne whenever he had been so fortunate as to
borrow a guinea. If his questing had been unsuccessful, he
appeased the rage of hunger with some scraps of broken meat,  <span class="linenum">25</span>
and lay down to rest under the Piazza of Covent Garden in
warm weather, and, in cold weather, as near as he could get
to the furnace of a glass house. Yet, in his misery, he was still
an agreeable companion. He had an inexhaustible store of
anecdotes about that gay and brilliant world from which he  <span class="linenum">30</span>
was now an outcast. He had observed the great men of both
parties in hours of careless relaxation, had seen the leaders
of opposition without the mask of patriotism, and had heard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>the prime minister roar with laughter and tell stories not over
decent. During some months Savage lived in the closest
familiarity with Johnson; and then the friends parted, not
without tears. Johnson remained in London to drudge for
Cave. Savage went to the West of England, lived there as
he had lived everywhere, and, in 1743, died, penniless and  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
heart-broken, in Bristol gaol.</p>

<p>17. Soon after his death, while the public curiosity was
strongly excited about his extraordinary character, and his
not less extraordinary adventures, a life of him appeared
widely different from the catchpenny lives of eminent men  <span class="linenum">10</span>
which were then a staple article of manufacture in Grub
Street. The style was indeed deficient in ease and variety;
and the writer was evidently too partial to the Latin element
of our language. But the little work, with all its faults, was
a masterpiece. No finer specimen of literary biography existed  <span class="linenum">15</span>
in any language, living or dead; and a discerning critic might
have confidently predicted that the author was destined to be
the founder of a new school of English eloquence.</p>

<p>18. The life of Savage was anonymous; but it was well
known in literary circles that Johnson was the writer. During  <span class="linenum">20</span>
the three years which followed, he produced no important
work; but he was not, and indeed could not be, idle. The fame
of his abilities and learning continued to grow. Warburton
pronounced him a man of parts and genius; and the praise
of Warburton was then no light thing. Such was Johnson's  <span class="linenum">25</span>
reputation that, in 1747, several eminent booksellers combined
to employ him in the arduous work of preparing a
Dictionary of the English language, in two folio volumes. The
sum which they agreed to pay him was only fifteen hundred
guineas; and out of this sum he had to pay several poor men  <span class="linenum">30</span>
of letters who assisted him in the humbler parts of his task.</p>

<p>19. The prospectus of the Dictionary he addressed to the
Earl of Chesterfield. Chesterfield had long been celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>for the politeness of his manners, the brilliancy of his wit,
and the delicacy of his taste. He was acknowledged to be
the finest speaker in the House of Lords. He had recently
governed Ireland, at a momentous conjuncture, with eminent
firmness, wisdom, and humanity; and he had since become
Secretary of State. He received Johnson's homage with the  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
most winning affability, and requited it with a few guineas,
bestowed doubtless in a very graceful manner, but was by no
means desirous to see all his carpets blackened with the London
mud, and his soups and wines thrown to right and left over
the gowns of fine ladies and the waistcoats of fine gentlemen,  <span class="linenum">10</span>
by an absent, awkward scholar, who gave strange starts and
uttered strange growls, who dressed like a scarecrow, and ate
like a cormorant. During some time Johnson continued to
call on his patron, but after being repeatedly told by the
porter that his lordship was not at home, took the hint, and  <span class="linenum">15</span>
ceased to present himself at the inhospitable door.</p>

<p>20. Johnson had flattered himself that he should have completed
his Dictionary by the end of 1750; but it was not till
1755 that he at length gave his huge volumes to the world.
During the seven years which he passed in the drudgery of   <span class="linenum">20</span>
penning definitions and marking quotations for transcription,
he sought for relaxation in literary labour of a more agreeable
kind. In 1749 he published the Vanity of Human Wishes,
an excellent imitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal. It is
in truth not easy to say whether the palm belongs to the  <span class="linenum">25</span>
ancient or to the modern poet. The couplets in which the
fall of Wolsey is described, though lofty and sonorous, are feeble
when compared with the wonderful lines which bring before us
all Rome in tumult on the day of the fall of Sejanus, the laurels
on the doorposts, the white bull stalking towards the Capitol,  <span class="linenum">30</span>
the statues rolling down from their pedestals, the flatterers of
the disgraced minister running to see him dragged with a hook
through the streets, and to have a kick at his carcase before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>it is hurled into the Tiber. It must be owned too that in the
concluding passage the Christian moralist has not made the
most of his advantages, and has fallen decidedly short of
the sublimity of his pagan model. On the other hand, Juvenal's
Hannibal must yield to Johnson's Charles; and Johnson's
vigorous and pathetic enumeration of the miseries of a literary  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
life must be allowed to be superior to Juvenal's lamentation
over the fate of Demosthenes and Cicero.</p>

<p>21. For the copyright of the Vanity of Human Wishes
Johnson received only fifteen guineas.</p>

<p>22. A few days after the publication of this poem, his  <span class="linenum">10</span>
tragedy, begun many years before, was brought on the stage.
His pupil, David Garrick, had, in 1741, made his appearance
on a humble stage in Goodman's Fields, had at once risen to the
first place among actors, and was now, after several years of
almost uninterrupted success, manager of Drury Lane Theatre.  <span class="linenum">15</span>
The relation between him and his old preceptor was of a very
singular kind. They repelled each other strongly, and yet
attracted each other strongly. Nature had made them of very
different clay; and circumstances had fully brought out the
natural peculiarities of both. Sudden prosperity had turned  <span class="linenum">20</span>
Garrick's head. Continued adversity had soured Johnson's
temper. Johnson saw with more envy than became so great
a man the villa, the plate, the china, the Brussels carpet, which
the little mimic had got by repeating, with grimaces and
gesticulations, what wiser men had written; and the exquisitely   <span class="linenum">25</span>
sensitive vanity of Garrick was galled by the thought that,
while all the rest of the world was applauding him, he could
obtain from one morose cynic, whose opinion it was impossible
to despise, scarcely any compliment not acidulated with scorn.
Yet the two Lichfield men had so many early recollections in  <span class="linenum">30</span>
common, and sympathised with each other on so many points
on which they sympathised with nobody else in the vast population
of the capital, that, though the master was often provoked
by the monkey-like impertinence of the pupil, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>pupil by the bearish rudeness of the master, they remained
friends till they were parted by death. Garrick now brought
Irene out, with alterations sufficient to displease the author,
yet not sufficient to make the piece pleasing to the audience.
The public, however, listened with little emotion, but with  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
much civility, to five acts of monotonous declamation. After
nine representations the play was withdrawn. It is, indeed,
altogether unsuited to the stage, and, even when perused in
the closet, will be found hardly worthy of the author. He had
not the slightest notion of what blank verse should be. A   <span class="linenum">10</span>
change in the last syllable of every other line would make the
versification of the Vanity of Human Wishes closely resemble
the versification of Irene. The poet, however, cleared, by
his benefit nights, and by the sale of the copyright of his
tragedy, about three hundred pounds, then a great sum in   <span class="linenum">15</span>
his estimation.</p>

<p>23. About a year after the representation of Irene, he
began to publish a series of short essays on morals, manners,
and literature. This species of composition had been brought
into fashion by the success of the Tatler, and by the still more  <span class="linenum">20</span>
brilliant success of the Spectator. A crowd of small writers
had vainly attempted to rival Addison. The Lay Monastery,
the Censor, the Freethinker, the Plain Dealer, the Champion,
and other works of the same kind, had had their short day.
None of them had obtained a permanent place in our literature;  <span class="linenum">25</span>
and they are now to be found only in the libraries of
the curious. At length Johnson undertook the adventure in
which so many aspirants had failed. In the thirty-sixth year
after the appearance of the last number of the Spectator
appeared the first number of the Rambler. From March  <span class="linenum">30</span>
1750 to March 1752, this paper continued to come out every
Tuesday and Saturday.</p>

<p>24. From the first the Rambler was enthusiastically admired
by a few eminent men. Richardson, when only five numbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>had appeared, pronounced it equal, if not superior, to the
Spectator. Young and Hartley expressed their approbation
not less warmly. Bubb Dodington, among whose many faults
indifference to the claims of genius and learning cannot be
reckoned, solicited the acquaintance of the writer. In consequence  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
probably of the good offices of Dodington, who was
then the confidential adviser of Prince Frederic, two of His
Royal Highness's gentlemen carried a gracious message to
the printing office, and ordered seven copies for Leicester
House. But these overtures seem to have been very coldly   <span class="linenum">10</span>
received. Johnson had had enough of the patronage of the
great to last him all his life, and was not disposed to haunt
any other door as he had haunted the door of Chesterfield.</p>

<p>25. By the public the Rambler was at first very coldly
received. Though the price of a number was only twopence,  <span class="linenum">15</span>
the sale did not amount to five hundred. The profits were
therefore very small. But as soon as the flying leaves were
collected and reprinted they became popular. The author
lived to see thirteen thousand copies spread over England
alone. Separate editions were published for the Scotch and   <span class="linenum">20</span>
Irish markets. A large party pronounced the style perfect, so
absolutely perfect that in some essays it would be impossible
for the writer himself to alter a single word for the better.
Another party, not less numerous, vehemently accused him of
having corrupted the purity of the English tongue. The best  <span class="linenum">25</span>
critics admitted that his diction was too monotonous, too obviously
artificial, and now and then turgid even to absurdity.
But they did justice to the acuteness of his observations on
morals and manners, to the constant precision and frequent
brilliancy of his language, to the weighty and magnificent  <span class="linenum">30</span>
eloquence of many serious passages, and to the solemn yet pleasing
humour of some of the lighter papers. On the question
of precedence between Addison and Johnson, a question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>which, seventy years ago, was much disputed, posterity has
pronounced a decision from which there is no appeal. Sir
Roger, his chaplain and his butler, Will Wimble and Will
Honeycomb, the Vision of Mirza, the Journal of the Retired
Citizen, the Everlasting Club, the Dunmow Flitch, the Loves
of Hilpah and Shalum, the Visit to the Exchange, and the   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
Visit to the Abbey, are known to everybody. But many men
and women, even of highly cultivated minds, are unacquainted
with Squire Bluster and Mrs. Busy, Quisquilius and Venustulus,
the Allegory of Wit and Learning, the Chronicle of the Revolutions
of a Garret, and the sad fate of Aningait and Ajut.  <span class="linenum">10</span></p>

<p>26. The last Rambler was written in a sad and gloomy
hour. Mrs. Johnson had been given over by the physicians.
Three days later she died. She left her husband almost
broken-hearted. Many people had been surprised to see a
man of his genius and learning stooping to every drudgery,  <span class="linenum">15</span>
and denying himself almost every comfort, for the purpose of
supplying a silly, affected old woman with superfluities, which
she accepted with but little gratitude. But all his affection
had been concentrated on her. He had neither brother nor
sister, neither son nor daughter. To him she was beautiful as  <span class="linenum">20</span>
the Gunnings, and witty as Lady Mary. Her opinion of his
writings was more important to him than the voice of the
pit of Drury Lane Theatre or the judgment of the Monthly
Review. The chief support which had sustained him through
the most arduous labour of his life was the hope that she would  <span class="linenum">25</span>
enjoy the fame and the profit which he anticipated from his
Dictionary. She was gone; and in that vast labyrinth of
streets, peopled by eight hundred thousand human beings,
he was alone. Yet it was necessary for him to set himself, as
he expressed it, doggedly to work. After three more laborious  <span class="linenum">30</span>
years, the Dictionary was at length complete.</p>

<p>27. It had been generally supposed that this great work
would be dedicated to the eloquent and accomplished nobleman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>to whom the prospectus had been addressed. He well
knew the value of such a compliment; and therefore, when
the day of publication drew near, he exerted himself to soothe,
by a show of zealous and at the same time of delicate and
judicious kindness, the pride which he had so cruelly wounded.
Since the Ramblers had ceased to appear, the town had been  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
entertained by a journal called The World, to which many men
of high rank and fashion contributed. In two successive numbers
of the World the Dictionary was, to use the modern phrase,
puffed with wonderful skill. The writings of Johnson were
warmly praised. It was proposed that he should be invested  <span class="linenum">10</span>
with the authority of a Dictator, nay, of a Pope, over our
language, and that his decisions about the meaning and the
spelling of words should be received as final. His two folios,
it was said, would of course be bought by everybody who could
afford to buy them. It was soon known that these papers were  <span class="linenum">15</span>
written by Chesterfield. But the just resentment of Johnson
was not to be so appeased. In a letter written with singular
energy and dignity of thought and language, he repelled the
tardy advances of his patron. The Dictionary came forth without
a dedication. In the preface the author truly declared that   <span class="linenum">20</span>
he owed nothing to the great, and described the difficulties with
which he had been left to struggle so forcibly and pathetically
that the ablest and most malevolent of all the enemies of his
fame, Horne Tooke, never could read that passage without tears.</p>

<p>28. The public, on this occasion, did Johnson full justice,  <span class="linenum">25</span>
and something more than justice. The best lexicographer
may well be content if his productions are received by the
world with cold esteem. But Johnson's Dictionary was hailed
with an enthusiasm such as no similar work has ever excited.
It was indeed the first dictionary which could be read with  <span class="linenum">30</span>
pleasure. The definitions show so much acuteness of thought
and command of language, and the passages quoted from poets,
divines, and philosophers are so skilfully selected, that a leisure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>hour may always be very agreeably spent in turning over the
pages. The faults of the book resolve themselves, for the most
part, into one great fault. Johnson was a wretched etymologist.
He knew little or nothing of any Teutonic language
except English, which indeed, as he wrote it, was scarcely a
Teutonic language; and thus he was absolutely at the mercy  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
of Junius and Skinner.</p>

<p>29. The Dictionary, though it raised Johnson's fame, added
nothing to his pecuniary means. The fifteen hundred guineas
which the booksellers had agreed to pay him had been advanced
and spent before the last sheets issued from the press. It is  <span class="linenum">10</span>
painful to relate that, twice in the course of the year which
followed the publication of this great work, he was arrested
and carried to spunging-houses, and that he was twice indebted
for his liberty to his excellent friend Richardson. It was still
necessary for the man who had been formally saluted by the   <span class="linenum">15</span>
highest authority as Dictator of the English language to supply
his wants by constant toil. He abridged his Dictionary. He
proposed to bring out an edition of Shakspeare by subscription;
and many subscribers sent in their names and laid down their
money; but he soon found the task so little to his taste that  <span class="linenum">20</span>
he turned to more attractive employments. He contributed
many papers to a new monthly journal, which was called the
Literary Magazine. Few of these papers have much interest;
but among them was the very best thing that he ever wrote, a
masterpiece both of reasoning and of satirical pleasantry, the  <span class="linenum">25</span>
review of Jenyns's Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Evil.</p>

<p>30. In the spring of 1758 Johnson put forth the first of a
series of essays, entitled The Idler. During two years these
essays continued to appear weekly. They were eagerly read,
widely circulated, and, indeed, impudently pirated, while they  <span class="linenum">30</span>
were still in the original form, and had a large sale when collected
into volumes. The Idler may be described as a second
part of the Rambler, somewhat livelier and somewhat weaker
than the first part.</p>

<p>31. While Johnson was busied with his Idlers, his mother, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
had accomplished her ninetieth year, died at Lichfield. It was
long since he had seen her; but he had not failed to contribute
largely, out of his small means, to her comfort. In order to
defray the charges of her funeral, and to pay some debts which  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
she had left, he wrote a little book in a single week, and sent
off the sheets to the press without reading them over. A
hundred pounds were paid him for the copyright; and the
purchasers had great cause to be pleased with their bargain;
for the book was Rasselas.  <span class="linenum">10</span></p>

<p>32. The success of Rasselas was great, though such ladies
as Miss Lydia Languish must have been grievously disappointed
when they found that the new volume from the circulating
library was little more than a dissertation on the author's
favourite theme, the Vanity of Human Wishes; that the Prince  <span class="linenum">15</span>
of Abyssinia was without a mistress, and the Princess without a
lover; and that the story set the hero and the heroine down
exactly where it had taken them up. The style was the subject
of much eager controversy. The Monthly Review and the
Critical Review took different sides. Many readers pronounced  <span class="linenum">20</span>
the writer a pompous pedant, who would never use a word of
two syllables where it was possible to use a word of six, and
who could not make a waiting woman relate her adventures
without balancing every noun with another noun, and every
epithet with another epithet. Another party, not less zealous,  <span class="linenum">25</span>
cited with delight numerous passages in which weighty meaning
was expressed with accuracy and illustrated with splendour.
And both the censure and the praise were merited.</p>

<p>33. About the plan of Rasselas little was said by the
critics; and yet the faults of the plan might seem to invite  <span class="linenum">30</span>
severe criticism. Johnson has frequently blamed Shakspeare
for neglecting the proprieties of time and place, and for ascribing
to one age or nation the manners and opinions of another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>Yet Shakspeare has not sinned in this way more grievously
than Johnson. Rasselas and Imlac, Nekayah and Pekuah, are
evidently meant to be Abyssinians of the eighteenth century:
for the Europe which Imlac describes is the Europe of the
eighteenth century; and the inmates of the Happy Valley
talk familiarly of that law of gravitation which Newton discovered,  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
and which was not fully received even at Cambridge
till the eighteenth century. What a real company of Abyssinians
would have been may be learned from Bruce's Travels.
But Johnson, not content with turning filthy savages, ignorant
of their letters, and gorged with raw steaks cut from living  <span class="linenum">10</span>
cows, into philosophers as eloquent and enlightened as himself
or his friend Burke, and into ladies as highly accomplished as
Mrs. Lennox or Mrs. Sheridan, transferred the whole domestic
system of England to Egypt. Into a land of harems, a land of
polygamy, a land where women are married without ever being   <span class="linenum">15</span>
seen, he introduced the flirtations and jealousies of our ballrooms.
In a land where there is boundless liberty of divorce,
wedlock is described as the indissoluble compact. "A youth
and maiden meeting by chance, or brought together by artifice,
exchange glances, reciprocate civilities, go home, and dream  <span class="linenum">20</span>
of each other. Such," says Rasselas, "is the common process
of marriage." Such it may have been, and may still be, in
London, but assuredly not at Cairo. A writer who was guilty
of such improprieties had little right to blame the poet who
made Hector quote Aristotle, and represented Julio Romano  <span class="linenum">25</span>
as flourishing in the days of the oracle of Delphi.</p>

<p>34. By such exertions as have been described, Johnson
supported himself till the year 1762. In that year a great
change in his circumstances took place. He had from a child
been an enemy of the reigning dynasty. His Jacobite prejudices  <span class="linenum">30</span>
had been exhibited with little disguise both in his works
and in his conversation. Even in his massy and elaborate
Dictionary, he had, with a strange want of taste and judgment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>inserted bitter and contumelious reflections on the Whig party.
The excise, which was a favourite resource of Whig financiers,
he had designated as a hateful tax. He had railed against the
commissioners of excise in language so coarse that they had
seriously thought of prosecuting him. He had with difficulty
been prevented from holding up the Lord Privy Seal by name  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
as an example of the meaning of the word "renegade." A
pension he had defined as pay given to a state hireling to betray
his country; a pensioner as a slave of state hired by a stipend
to obey a master. It seemed unlikely that the author of these
definitions would himself be pensioned. But that was a time   <span class="linenum">10</span>
of wonders. George the Third had ascended the throne; and
had, in the course of a few months, disgusted many of the old
friends and conciliated many of the old enemies of his house.
The city was becoming mutinous. Oxford was becoming loyal.
Cavendishes and Bentincks were murmuring. Somersets and  <span class="linenum">15</span>
Wyndhams were hastening to kiss hands. The head of the
treasury was now Lord Bute, who was a Tory, and could have
no objection to Johnson's Toryism. Bute wished to be thought
a patron of men of letters; and Johnson was one of the most
eminent and one of the most needy men of letters in Europe.  <span class="linenum">20</span>
A pension of three hundred a year was graciously offered, and
with very little hesitation accepted.</p>

<p>35. This event produced a change in Johnson's whole way
of life. For the first time since his boyhood he no longer felt
the daily goad urging him to the daily toil. He was at liberty,  <span class="linenum">25</span>
after thirty years of anxiety and drudgery, to indulge his
constitutional indolence, to lie in bed till two in the afternoon,
and to sit up talking till four in the morning, without fearing
either the printer's devil or the sheriff's officer.</p>

<p>36. One laborious task indeed he had bound himself to   <span class="linenum">30</span>
perform. He had received large subscriptions for his promised
edition of Shakspeare; he had lived on those subscriptions
during some years; and he could not without disgrace omit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>to perform his part of the contract. His friends repeatedly
exhorted him to make an effort; and he repeatedly resolved
to do so. But, notwithstanding their exhortations and his
resolutions, month followed month, year followed year, and
nothing was done. He prayed fervently against his idleness;
he determined, as often as he received the sacrament, that  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
he would no longer doze away and trifle away his time; but
the spell under which he lay resisted prayer and sacrament.
His private notes at this time are made up of self-reproaches.
"My indolence," he wrote on Easter eve in 1764, "has sunk
into grosser sluggishness. A kind of strange oblivion has  <span class="linenum">10</span>
overspread me, so that I know not what has become of the last
year." Easter 1765 came, and found him still in the same
state. "My time," he wrote, "has been unprofitably spent,
and seems as a dream that has left nothing behind. My
memory grows confused, and I know not how the days pass   <span class="linenum">15</span>
over me." Happily for his honour, the charm which held him
captive was at length broken by no gentle or friendly hand.
He had been weak enough to pay serious attention to a story
about a ghost which haunted a house in Cock Lane, and had
actually gone himself with some of his friends, at one in the  <span class="linenum">20</span>
morning, to St. John's Church, Clerkenwell, in the hope of
receiving a communication from the perturbed spirit. But the
spirit, though adjured with all solemnity, remained obstinately
silent; and it soon appeared that a naughty girl of eleven had
been amusing herself by making fools of so many philosophers.  <span class="linenum">25</span>
Churchill, who, confident in his powers, drunk with popularity,
and burning with party spirit, was looking for some man of
established fame and Tory politics to insult, celebrated the
Cock Lane Ghost in three cantos, nicknamed Johnson Pomposo,
asked where the book was which had been so long  <span class="linenum">30</span>
promised and so liberally paid for, and directly accused the
great moralist of cheating. This terrible word proved effectual;
and in October 1765 appeared, after a delay of nine
years, the new edition of Shakspeare.</p>

<p>37. This publication saved Johnson's character for honesty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
but added nothing to the fame of his abilities and learning.
The preface, though it contains some good passages, is not in
his best manner. The most valuable notes are those in which
he had an opportunity of showing how attentively he had   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
during many years observed human life and human nature.
The best specimen is the note on the character of Polonius.
Nothing so good is to be found even in Wilhelm Meister's
admirable examination of Hamlet. But here praise must end.
It would be difficult to name a more slovenly, a more worthless  <span class="linenum">10</span>
edition of any great classic. The reader may turn over play
after play without finding one happy conjectural emendation,
or one ingenious and satisfactory explanation of a passage
which had baffled preceding commentators. Johnson had, in
his prospectus, told the world that he was peculiarly fitted for  <span class="linenum">15</span>
the task which he had undertaken, because he had, as a
lexicographer, been under the necessity of taking a wider view of
the English language than any of his predecessors. That his
knowledge of our literature was extensive is indisputable. But,
unfortunately, he had altogether neglected that very part of   <span class="linenum">20</span>
our literature with which it is especially desirable that an editor
of Shakspeare should be conversant. It is dangerous to assert
a negative. Yet little will be risked by the assertion, that in
the two folio volumes of the English Dictionary there is not a
single passage quoted from any dramatist of the Elizabethan  <span class="linenum">25</span>
age, except Shakspeare and Ben. Even from Ben the quotations
are few. Johnson might easily, in a few months, have
made himself well acquainted with every old play that was
extant. But it never seems to have occurred to him that this
was a necessary preparation for the work which he had undertaken.  <span class="linenum">30</span>
He would doubtless have admitted that it would be
the height of absurdity in a man who was not familiar with
the works of Æschylus and Euripides to publish an edition of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>Sophocles. Yet he ventured to publish an edition of Shakspeare,
without having ever in his life, as far as can be discovered,
read a single scene of Massinger, Ford, Decker, Webster,
Marlow, Beaumont, or Fletcher. His detractors were noisy
and scurrilous. Those who most loved and honoured him had
little to say in praise of the manner in which he had discharged  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
the duty of a commentator. He had, however, acquitted himself
of a debt which had long lain heavy on his conscience;
and he sank back into the repose from which the sting of satire
had roused him. He long continued to live upon the fame
which he had already won. He was honoured by the University  <span class="linenum">10</span>
of Oxford with a Doctor's degree, by the Royal Academy
with a professorship, and by the King with an interview, in
which his Majesty most graciously expressed a hope that so
excellent a writer would not cease to write. In the interval,
however, between 1765 and 1775 Johnson published only two   <span class="linenum">15</span>
or three political tracts, the longest of which he could have
produced in forty-eight hours, if he had worked as he worked
on the Life of Savage and on Rasselas.</p>

<p>38. But, though his pen was now idle, his tongue was active.
The influence exercised by his conversation, directly upon  <span class="linenum">20</span>
those with whom he lived, and indirectly on the whole literary
world, was altogether without a parallel. His colloquial talents
were indeed of the highest order. He had strong sense, quick
discernment, wit, humour, immense knowledge of literature
and of life, and an infinite store of curious anecdotes. As   <span class="linenum">25</span>
respected style, he spoke far better than he wrote. Every sentence
which dropped from his lips was as correct in structure
as the most nicely balanced period of the Rambler. But in
his talk there were no pompous triads, and little more than a fair
proportion of words in <i>osity</i> and <i>ation</i>. All was simplicity,  <span class="linenum">30</span>
ease, and vigour. He uttered his short, weighty, and pointed
sentences with a power of voice, and a justness and energy of
emphasis, of which the effect was rather increased than diminished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>by the rollings of his huge form, and by the asthmatic
gaspings and puffings in which the peals of his eloquence generally
ended. Nor did the laziness which made him unwilling
to sit down to his desk prevent him from giving instruction or
entertainment orally. To discuss questions of taste, of learning,
of casuistry, in language so exact and so forcible that it might  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
have been printed without the alteration of a word, was to him
no exertion, but a pleasure. He loved, as he said, to fold his
legs and have his talk out. He was ready to bestow the overflowings
of his full mind on anybody who would start a subject,
on a fellow-passenger in a stage coach, or on the person who  <span class="linenum">10</span>
sate at the same table with him in an eating-house. But his
conversation was nowhere so brilliant and striking as when he
was surrounded by a few friends, whose abilities and knowledge
enabled them, as he once expressed it, to send him back every
ball that he threw. Some of these, in 1764, formed themselves  <span class="linenum">15</span>
into a club, which gradually became a formidable power in the
commonwealth of letters. The verdicts pronounced by this
conclave on new books were speedily known over all London,
and were sufficient to sell off a whole edition in a day, or to
condemn the sheets to the service of the trunk-maker and the  <span class="linenum">20</span>
pastry-cook. Nor shall we think this strange when we consider
what great and various talents and acquirements met in the
little fraternity. Goldsmith was the representative of poetry
and light literature, Reynolds of the arts, Burke of political
eloquence and political philosophy. There, too, were Gibbon,  <span class="linenum">25</span>
the greatest historian, and Jones, the greatest linguist, of the
age. Garrick brought to the meetings his inexhaustible pleasantry,
his incomparable mimicry, and his consummate knowledge
of stage effect. Among the most constant attendants
were two high-born and high-bred gentlemen, closely bound  <span class="linenum">30</span>
together by friendship, but of widely different characters and
habits; Bennet Langton, distinguished by his skill in Greek
literature, by the orthodoxy of his opinions, and by the sanctity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>of his life; and Topham Beauclerk, renowned for his amours,
his knowledge of the gay world, his fastidious taste, and his
sarcastic wit. To predominate over such a society was not
easy. Yet even over such a society Johnson predominated.
Burke might indeed have disputed the supremacy to which
others were under the necessity of submitting. But Burke,   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
though not generally a very patient listener, was content to
take the second part when Johnson was present; and the
club itself, consisting of so many eminent men, is to this
day popularly designated as Johnson's Club.</p>

<p>39. Among the members of this celebrated body was one   <span class="linenum">10</span>
to whom it has owed the greater part of its celebrity, yet who
was regarded with little respect by his brethren, and had not
without difficulty obtained a seat among them. This was
James Boswell, a young Scotch lawyer, heir to an honourable
name and a fair estate. That he was a coxcomb and a bore,  <span class="linenum">15</span>
weak, vain, pushing, curious, garrulous, was obvious to all who
were acquainted with him. That he could not reason, that
he had no wit, no humour, no eloquence, is apparent from
his writings. And yet his writings are read beyond the Mississippi,
and under the Southern Cross, and are likely to be  <span class="linenum">20</span>
read as long as the English exists, either as a living or as a
dead language. Nature had made him a slave and an idolater.
His mind resembled those creepers which the botanists call
parasites, and which can subsist only by clinging round the
stems and imbibing the juices of stronger plants. He must   <span class="linenum">25</span>
have fastened himself on somebody. He might have fastened
himself on Wilkes, and have become the fiercest patriot in the
Bill of Rights Society. He might have fastened himself on
Whitfield, and have become the loudest field preacher among
the Calvinistic Methodists. In a happy hour he fastened himself  <span class="linenum">30</span>
on Johnson. The pair might seem ill matched. For
Johnson had early been prejudiced against Boswell's country.
To a man of Johnson's strong understanding and irritable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>temper, the silly egotism and adulation of Boswell must have
been as teasing as the constant buzz of a fly. Johnson hated
to be questioned; and Boswell was eternally catechising him
on all kinds of subjects, and sometimes propounded such
questions as "What would you do, sir, if you were locked up
in a tower with a baby?" Johnson was a water drinker; and   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
Boswell was a wine-bibber, and indeed little better than a
habitual sot. It was impossible that there should be perfect
harmony between two such companions. Indeed, the great
man was sometimes provoked into fits of passion in which he
said things which the small man, during a few hours, seriously  <span class="linenum">10</span>
resented. Every quarrel, however, was soon made up. During
twenty years the disciple continued to worship the master:
the master continued to scold the disciple, to sneer at him, and
to love him. The two friends ordinarily resided at a great
distance from each other. Boswell practised in the Parliament  <span class="linenum">15</span>
House of Edinburgh, and could pay only occasional
visits to London. During those visits his chief business was
to watch Johnson, to discover all Johnson's habits, to turn the
conversation to subjects about which Johnson was likely to
say something remarkable, and to fill quarto note books with  <span class="linenum">20</span>
minutes of what Johnson had said. In this way were gathered
the materials out of which was afterwards constructed the most
interesting biographical work in the world.</p>

<p>40. Soon after the club began to exist, Johnson formed a
connection less important indeed to his fame, but much more  <span class="linenum">25</span>
important to his happiness, than his connection with Boswell.
Henry Thrale, one of the most opulent brewers in the kingdom,
a man of sound and cultivated understanding, rigid principles,
and liberal spirit, was married to one of those clever,
kind-hearted, engaging, vain, pert young women, who are  <span class="linenum">30</span>
perpetually doing or saying what is not exactly right, but who, do
or say what they may, are always agreeable. In 1765 the
Thrales became acquainted with Johnson, and the acquaintance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>ripened fast into friendship. They were astonished and
delighted by the brilliancy of his conversation. They were
flattered by finding that a man so widely celebrated, preferred
their house to any other in London. Even the peculiarities
which seemed to unfit him for civilised society, his gesticulations,
his rollings, his puffings, his mutterings, the strange way  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
in which he put on his clothes, the ravenous eagerness with
which he devoured his dinner, his fits of melancholy, his fits of
anger, his frequent rudeness, his occasional ferocity, increased
the interest which his new associates took in him. For these
things were the cruel marks left behind by a life which had   <span class="linenum">10</span>
been one long conflict with disease and with adversity. In a
vulgar hack writer such oddities would have excited only disgust.
But in a man of genius, learning, and virtue their effect
was to add pity to admiration and esteem. Johnson soon had
an apartment at the brewery in Southwark, and a still more   <span class="linenum">15</span>
pleasant apartment at the villa of his friends on Streatham
Common. A large part of every year he passed in those
abodes, abodes which must have seemed magnificent and luxurious
indeed, when compared with the dens in which he had
generally been lodged. But his chief pleasures were derived  <span class="linenum">20</span>
from what the astronomer of his Abyssinian tale called "the
endearing elegance of female friendship." Mrs. Thrale rallied
him, soothed him, coaxed him, and, if she sometimes provoked
him by her flippancy, made ample amends by listening to his
reproofs with angelic sweetness of temper. When he was   <span class="linenum">25</span>
diseased in body and in mind, she was the most tender of
nurses. No comfort that wealth could purchase, no contrivance
that womanly ingenuity, set to work by womanly compassion,
could devise, was wanting to his sick-room. He
requited her kindness by an affection pure as the affection of  <span class="linenum">30</span>
a father, yet delicately tinged with a gallantry which, though
awkward, must have been more flattering than the attentions
of a crowd of the fools who gloried in the names, now obsolete,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>of Buck and Maccaroni. It should seem that a full half of
Johnson's life, during about sixteen years, was passed under
the roof of the Thrales. He accompanied the family sometimes
to Bath, and sometimes to Brighton, once to Wales, and once
to Paris. But he had at the same time a house in one of the
narrow and gloomy courts on the north of Fleet Street. In   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
the garrets was his library, a large and miscellaneous collection
of books, falling to pieces and begrimed with dust. On
a lower floor he sometimes, but very rarely, regaled a friend
with a plain dinner, a veal pie, or a leg of lamb and spinage,
and a rice pudding. Nor was the dwelling uninhabited during  <span class="linenum">10</span>
his long absences. It was the home of the most extraordinary
assemblage of inmates that ever was brought together. At
the head of the establishment Johnson had placed an old
lady named Williams, whose chief recommendations were her
blindness and her poverty. But, in spite of her murmurs and  <span class="linenum">15</span>
reproaches, he gave an asylum to another lady who was as poor
as herself, Mrs. Desmoulins, whose family he had known many
years before in Staffordshire. Room was found for the daughter
of Mrs. Desmoulins, and for another destitute damsel, who was
generally addressed as Miss Carmichael, but whom her generous  <span class="linenum">20</span>
host called Polly. An old quack doctor named Levett,
who bled and dosed coal-heavers and hackney coachmen, and
received for fees crusts of bread, bits of bacon, glasses of gin,
and sometimes a little copper, completed this strange menagerie.
All these poor creatures were at constant war with each   <span class="linenum">25</span>
other, and with Johnson's negro servant Frank. Sometimes,
indeed, they transferred their hostilities from the servant to
the master, complained that a better table was not kept for
them, and railed or maundered till their benefactor was glad to
make his escape to Streatham, or to the Mitre Tavern. And  <span class="linenum">30</span>
yet he, who was generally the haughtiest and most irritable
of mankind, who was but too prompt to resent anything which
looked like a slight on the part of a purse-proud bookseller,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>or of a noble and powerful patron, bore patiently from
mendicants, who, but for his bounty, must have gone to the
workhouse, insults more provoking than those for which he had
knocked down Osborne and bidden defiance to Chesterfield.
Year after year Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Desmoulins, Polly, and
Levett continued to torment him and to live upon him.  <span class="linenum in1">5</span></p>

<p>41. The course of life which has been described was
interrupted in Johnson's sixty-fourth year by an important
event. He had early read an account of the Hebrides, and
had been much interested by learning that there was so near
him a land peopled by a race which was still as rude and   <span class="linenum">10</span>
simple as in the middle ages. A wish to become intimately
acquainted with a state of society so utterly unlike all that he
had ever seen frequently crossed his mind. But it is not
probable that his curiosity would have overcome his habitual
sluggishness, and his love of the smoke, the mud, and the   <span class="linenum">15</span>
cries of London, had not Boswell importuned him to attempt
the adventure, and offered to be his squire. At length, in
August 1773, Johnson crossed the Highland line, and plunged
courageously into what was then considered, by most Englishmen,
as a dreary and perilous wilderness. After wandering   <span class="linenum">20</span>
about two months through the Celtic region, sometimes in
rude boats which did not protect him from the rain, and
sometimes on small shaggy ponies which could hardly bear
his weight, he returned to his old haunts with a mind full of
new images and new theories. During the following year he   <span class="linenum">25</span>
employed himself in recording his adventures. About the
beginning of 1775, his Journey to the Hebrides was published,
and was, during some weeks, the chief subject of conversation
in all circles in which any attention was paid to literature.
The book is still read with pleasure. The narrative is   <span class="linenum">30</span>
entertaining; the speculations, whether sound or unsound, are
always ingenious; and the style, though too stiff and pompous,
is somewhat easier and more graceful than that of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>early writings. His prejudice against the Scotch had at
length become little more than matter of jest; and whatever
remained of the old feeling had been effectually removed by
the kind and respectful hospitality with which he had been
received in every part of Scotland. It was, of course, not to
be expected that an Oxonian Tory should praise the Presbyterian  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
polity and ritual, or that an eye accustomed to the
hedgerows and parks of England should not be struck by the
bareness of Berwickshire and East Lothian. But even in
censure Johnson's tone is not unfriendly. The most enlightened
Scotchmen, with Lord Mansfield at their head, were  <span class="linenum">10</span>
well pleased. But some foolish and ignorant Scotchmen were
moved to anger by a little unpalatable truth which was
mingled with much eulogy, and assailed him whom they chose
to consider as the enemy of their country, with libels much
more dishonourable to their country than anything that he  <span class="linenum">15</span>
had ever said or written. They published paragraphs in the
newspapers, articles in the magazines, sixpenny pamphlets,
five-shilling books. One scribbler abused Johnson for being
blear-eyed; another for being a pensioner; a third informed
the world that one of the Doctor's uncles had been convicted  <span class="linenum">20</span>
of felony in Scotland, and had found that there was in that
country one tree capable of supporting the weight of an
Englishman. Macpherson, whose Fingal had been proved
in the Journey to be an impudent forgery, threatened to take
vengeance with a cane. The only effect of this threat was  <span class="linenum">25</span>
that Johnson reiterated the charge of forgery in the most
contemptuous terms, and walked about, during some time,
with a cudgel, which, if the impostor had not been too wise
to encounter it, would assuredly have descended upon him,
to borrow the sublime language of his own epic poem, "like   <span class="linenum">30</span>
a hammer on the red son of the furnace."</p>

<p>42. Of other assailants Johnson took no notice whatever.
He had early resolved never to be drawn into controversy;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>and he adhered to his resolution with a steadfastness which
is the more extraordinary, because he was, both intellectually
and morally, of the stuff of which controversialists are made.
In conversation, he was a singularly eager, acute, and pertinacious
disputant. When at a loss for good reasons, he
had recourse to sophistry; and, when heated by altercation,  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
he made unsparing use of sarcasm and invective. But, when
he took his pen in his hand, his whole character seemed
to be changed. A hundred bad writers misrepresented him
and reviled him; but not one of the hundred could boast of
having been thought by him worthy of a refutation, or even   <span class="linenum">10</span>
of a retort. The Kenricks, Campbells, MacNicols, and Hendersons
did their best to annoy him, in the hope that he would
give them importance by answering them. But the reader will
in vain search his works for any allusion to Kenrick or Campbell,
to MacNicol or Henderson. One Scotchman, bent on  <span class="linenum">15</span>
vindicating the fame of Scotch learning, defied him to the
combat in a detestable Latin hexameter.</p>


<p class="center">"Maxime, si tu vis, cupio contendere tecum."</p>

<p class="in0">But Johnson took no notice of the challenge. He had learned,
both from his own observation and from literary history,   <span class="linenum">20</span>
in which he was deeply read, that the place of books in
the public estimation is fixed, not by what is written about
them, but by what is written in them; and that an author
whose works are likely to live is very unwise if he stoops to
wrangle with detractors whose works are certain to die. He   <span class="linenum">25</span>
always maintained that fame was a shuttlecock which could
be kept up only by being beaten back, as well as beaten forward,
and which would soon fall if there were only one battledore.
No saying was oftener in his mouth than that fine
apophthegm of Bentley, that no man was ever written down  <span class="linenum">30</span>
but by himself.</p>

<p>43. Unhappily, a few months after the appearance of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>Journey to the Hebrides, Johnson did what none of his
envious assailants could have done, and to a certain extent
succeeded in writing himself down. The disputes between
England and her American colonies had reached a point at
which no amicable adjustment was possible. Civil war was
evidently impending; and the ministers seem to have thought  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
that the eloquence of Johnson might with advantage be
employed to inflame the nation against the opposition here,
and against the rebels beyond the Atlantic. He had already
written two or three tracts in defence of the foreign and
domestic policy of the government; and those tracts, though  <span class="linenum">10</span>
hardly worthy of him, were much superior to the crowd of
pamphlets which lay on the counters of Almon and Stockdale.
But his Taxation no Tyranny was a pitiable failure. The very
title was a silly phrase, which can have been recommended
to his choice by nothing but a jingling alliteration which he  <span class="linenum">15</span>
ought to have despised. The arguments were such as boys
use in debating societies. The pleasantry was as awkward as
the gambols of a hippopotamus. Even Boswell was forced to
own that, in this unfortunate piece, he could detect no trace
of his master's powers. The general opinion was that the   <span class="linenum">20</span>
strong faculties which had produced the Dictionary and the
Rambler were beginning to feel the effect of time and of
disease, and that the old man would best consult his credit
by writing no more.</p>

<p>44. But this was a great mistake. Johnson had failed, not  <span class="linenum">25</span>
because his mind was less vigorous than when he wrote Rasselas
in the evenings of a week, but because he had foolishly
chosen, or suffered others to choose for him, a subject such as
he would at no time have been competent to treat. He was
in no sense a statesman. He never willingly read or thought  <span class="linenum">30</span>
or talked about affairs of state. He loved biography, literary
history, the history of manners; but political history was
positively distasteful to him. The question at issue between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>the colonies and the mother country was a question about
which he had really nothing to say. He failed, therefore, as
the greatest men must fail when they attempt to do that for
which they are unfit; as Burke would have failed if Burke
had tried to write comedies like those of Sheridan; as Reynolds
would have failed if Reynolds had tried to paint landscapes   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
like those of Wilson. Happily, Johnson soon had an
opportunity of proving most signally that his failure was not
to be ascribed to intellectual decay.</p>

<p>45. On Easter eve 1777, some persons, deputed by a meeting
which consisted of forty of the first booksellers in London,  <span class="linenum">10</span>
called upon him. Though he had some scruples about doing
business at that season, he received his visitors with much civility.
They came to inform him that a new edition of the English
poets, from Cowley downwards, was in contemplation, and to ask
him to furnish short biographical prefaces. He readily undertook  <span class="linenum">15</span>
the task, a task for which he was pre-eminently qualified.
His knowledge of the literary history of England since the
Restoration was unrivalled. That knowledge he had derived
partly from books, and partly from sources which had long been
closed; from old Grub Street traditions; from the talk of  <span class="linenum">20</span>
forgotten poetasters and pamphleteers who had long been lying
in parish vaults; from the recollections of such men as Gilbert
Walmesley, who had conversed with the wits of Button's; Cibber,
who had mutilated the plays of two generations of dramatists;
Orrery, who had been admitted to the society of Swift; and   <span class="linenum">25</span>
Savage, who had rendered services of no very honourable kind
to Pope. The biographer therefore sate down to his task with
a mind full of matter. He had at first intended to give only
a paragraph to every minor poet, and only four or five pages
to the greatest name. But the flood of anecdote and criticism   <span class="linenum">30</span>
overflowed the narrow channel. The work, which was originally
meant to consist only of a few sheets, swelled into ten
volumes, small volumes, it is true, and not closely printed.
The first four appeared in 1779, the remaining six in 1781.</p>

<p>46. The Lives of the Poets are, on the whole, the best of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
Johnson's works. The narratives are as entertaining as any
novel. The remarks on life and on human nature are eminently
shrewd and profound. The criticisms are often excellent, and,
even when grossly and provokingly unjust, well deserve to be   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
studied. For, however erroneous they may be, they are never
silly. They are the judgments of a mind trammelled by prejudice
and deficient in sensibility, but vigorous and acute.
They therefore generally contain a portion of valuable truth
which deserves to be separated from the alloy; and, at the  <span class="linenum">10</span>
very worst, they mean something, a praise to which much of
what is called criticism in our time has no pretensions.</p>

<p>47. Savage's Life Johnson reprinted nearly as it had
appeared in 1744. Whoever, after reading that life, will
turn to the other lives will be struck by the difference of  <span class="linenum">15</span>
style. Since Johnson had been at ease in his circumstances
he had written little and had talked much. When, therefore,
he, after the lapse of years, resumed his pen, the mannerism
which he had contracted while he was in the constant habit
of elaborate composition was less perceptible than formerly;  <span class="linenum">20</span>
and his diction frequently had a colloquial ease which it had
formerly wanted. The improvement may be discerned by a
skilful critic in the Journey to the Hebrides, and in the Lives
of the Poets is so obvious that it cannot escape the notice of
the most careless reader.   <span class="linenum">25</span></p>

<p>48. Among the lives the best are perhaps those of Cowley,
Dryden, and Pope. The very worst is, beyond all doubt,
that of Gray.</p>

<p>49. This great work at once became popular. There was,
indeed, much just and much unjust censure: but even those   <span class="linenum">30</span>
who were loudest in blame were attracted by the book in
spite of themselves. Malone computed the gains of the publishers
at five or six thousand pounds. But the writer was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>very poorly remunerated. Intending at first to write very
short prefaces, he had stipulated for only two hundred guineas.
The booksellers, when they saw how far his performance had
surpassed his promise, added only another hundred. Indeed,
Johnson, though he did not despise, or affect to despise, money,
and though his strong sense and long experience ought to   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
have qualified him to protect his own interests, seems to have
been singularly unskilful and unlucky in his literary bargains.
He was generally reputed the first English writer of his time.
Yet several writers of his time sold their copyrights for sums
such as he never ventured to ask. To give a single instance,  <span class="linenum">10</span>
Robertson received four thousand five hundred pounds for
the History of Charles V.; and it is no disrespect to the
memory of Robertson to say that the History of Charles V.
is both a less valuable and a less amusing book than the Lives
of the Poets.   <span class="linenum">15</span></p>

<p>50. Johnson was now in his seventy-second year. The
infirmities of age were coming fast upon him. That inevitable
event of which he never thought without horror was brought
near to him; and his whole life was darkened by the shadow
of death. He had often to pay the cruel price of longevity.  <span class="linenum">20</span>
Every year he lost what could never be replaced. The strange
dependents to whom he had given shelter, and to whom,
in spite of their faults, he was strongly attached by habit,
dropped off one by one; and, in the silence of his home, he
regretted even the noise of their scolding matches. The kind  <span class="linenum">25</span>
and generous Thrale was no more; and it would have been
well if his wife had been laid beside him. But she survived
to be the laughing-stock of those who had envied her, and
to draw from the eyes of the old man who had loved her
beyond anything in the world tears far more bitter than he   <span class="linenum">30</span>
would have shed over her grave. With some estimable and
many agreeable qualities, she was not made to be independent.
The control of a mind more steadfast than her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>was necessary to her respectability. While she was restrained
by her husband, a man of sense and firmness, indulgent to
her taste in trifles, but always the undisputed master of his
house, her worst offences had been impertinent jokes, white
lies, and short fits of pettishness ending in sunny good humour.
But he was gone; and she was left an opulent widow of forty,  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
with strong sensibility, volatile fancy, and slender judgment.
She soon fell in love with a music-master from Brescia, in
whom nobody but herself could discover anything to admire.
Her pride, and perhaps some better feelings, struggled hard
against this degrading passion. But the struggle irritated her  <span class="linenum">10</span>
nerves, soured her temper, and at length endangered her
health. Conscious that her choice was one which Johnson
could not approve, she became desirous to escape from his
inspection. Her manner towards him changed. She was
sometimes cold and sometimes petulant. She did not conceal  <span class="linenum">15</span>
her joy when he left Streatham; she never pressed him
to return; and, if he came unbidden, she received him in a
manner which convinced him he was no longer a welcome
guest. He took the very intelligible hints which she gave.
He read, for the last time, a chapter of the Greek Testament in  <span class="linenum">20</span>
the library which had been formed by himself. In a solemn
and tender prayer he commended the house and its inmates
to the Divine protection, and, with emotions which choked
his voice and convulsed his powerful frame, left for ever that
beloved home for the gloomy and desolate house behind Fleet   <span class="linenum">25</span>
Street, where the few and evil days which still remained to
him were to run out. Here, in June 1783, he had a paralytic
stroke, from which, however, he recovered, and which
does not appear to have at all impaired his intellectual faculties.
But other maladies came thick upon him. His asthma  <span class="linenum">30</span>
tormented him day and night. Dropsical symptoms made
their appearance. While sinking under a complication of
diseases, he heard that the woman whose friendship had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>the chief happiness of sixteen years of his life had married an
Italian fiddler; that all London was crying shame upon her;
and that the newspapers and magazines were filled with
allusions to the Ephesian matron, and the two pictures in
Hamlet. He vehemently said that he would try to forget her
existence. He never uttered her name. Every memorial   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
of her which met his eye he flung into the fire. She meanwhile
fled from the laughter and hisses of her countrymen
and countrywomen to a land where she was unknown, hastened
across Mount Cenis, and learned, while passing a merry
Christmas of concerts and lemonade parties at Milan, that  <span class="linenum">10</span>
the great man with whose name hers is inseparably associated
had ceased to exist.</p>

<p>51. He had, in spite of much mental and much bodily
affliction, clung vehemently to life. The feeling described
in that fine but gloomy paper which closes the series of his  <span class="linenum">15</span>
Idlers seemed to grow stronger in him as his last hour drew
near. He fancied that he should be able to draw his breath
more easily in a southern climate, and would probably have
set out for Rome and Naples, but for his fear of the expense
of the journey. That expense, indeed, he had the means of   <span class="linenum">20</span>
defraying; for he had laid up about two thousand pounds,
the fruit of labours which had made the fortune of several
publishers. But he was unwilling to break in upon this hoard,
and he seems to have wished even to keep its existence a
secret. Some of his friends hoped that the government might  <span class="linenum">25</span>
be induced to increase his pension to six hundred pounds a
year, but this hope was disappointed, and he resolved to stand
one English winter more. That winter was his last. His
legs grew weaker; his breath grew shorter; the fatal water
gathered fast, in spite of incisions which he, courageous against  <span class="linenum">30</span>
pain, but timid against death, urged his surgeons to make
deeper and deeper. Though the tender care which had mitigated
his sufferings during months of sickness at Streatham
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>was withdrawn, he was not left desolate. The ablest physicians
and surgeons attended him, and refused to accept fees from
him. Burke parted from him with deep emotion. Windham
sate much in the sick-room, arranged the pillows, and sent his
own servant to watch at night by the bed. Frances Burney,
whom the old man had cherished with fatherly kindness, stood  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
weeping at the door; while Langton, whose piety eminently
qualified him to be an adviser and comforter at such a time,
received the last pressure of his friend's hand within. When
at length the moment, dreaded through so many years, came
close, the dark cloud passed away from Johnson's mind. His  <span class="linenum">10</span>
temper became unusually patient and gentle; he ceased to
think with terror of death, and of that which lies beyond
death; and he spoke much of the mercy of God, and of the
propitiation of Christ. In this serene frame of mind he died
on the 13th of December 1784. He was laid, a week later,   <span class="linenum">15</span>
in Westminster Abbey, among the eminent men of whom he
had been the historian,&mdash;Cowley and Denham, Dryden and
Congreve, Gay, Prior, and Addison.</p>

<p>52. Since his death the popularity of his works&mdash;the Lives
of the Poets, and, perhaps, the Vanity of Human Wishes,   <span class="linenum">20</span>
excepted&mdash;has greatly diminished. His Dictionary has been
altered by editors till it can scarcely be called his. An allusion
to his Rambler or his Idler is not readily apprehended in
literary circles. The fame even of Rasselas has grown somewhat
dim. But, though the celebrity of the writings may have   <span class="linenum">25</span>
declined, the celebrity of the writer, strange to say, is as great
as ever. Boswell's book has done for him more than the best
of his own books could do. The memory of other authors is
kept alive by their works. But the memory of Johnson keeps
many of his works alive. The old philosopher is still among   <span class="linenum">30</span>
us in the brown coat with the metal buttons and the shirt which
ought to be at wash, blinking, puffing, rolling his head, drumming
with his fingers, tearing his meat like a tiger, and swallowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>his tea in oceans. No human being who has been more
than seventy years in the grave is so well known to us. And
it is but just to say that our intimate acquaintance with what
he would himself have called the anfractuosities of his intellect
and of his temper serves only to strengthen our conviction that
he was both a great and a good man.  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>

<h2 class="vspace">FROM MACAULAY'S ESSAY ON CROKER'S
EDITION OF BOSWELL'S LIFE
OF JOHNSON<br />

<span class="smaller">(<i class="pub">Edinburgh Review, September, 1831</i>)</span></h2>

<p>
1. The Life of Johnson is assuredly a great, a very great
work. Homer is not more decidedly the first of heroic poets,
Shakspeare is not more decidedly the first of dramatists,
Demosthenes is not more decidedly the first of orators, than
Boswell is the first of biographers. He has no second. He has  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
distanced all his competitors so decidedly that it is not worth
while to place them. Eclipse is first, and the rest nowhere.</p>

<p>2. We are not sure that there is in the whole history of the
human intellect so strange a phænomenon as this book. Many
of the greatest men that ever lived have written biography.   <span class="linenum">10</span>
Boswell was one of the smallest men that ever lived, and he has
beaten them all. He was, if we are to give any credit to his
own account or to the united testimony of all who knew him, a
man of the meanest and feeblest intellect. Johnson described
him as a fellow who had missed his only chance of immortality  <span class="linenum">15</span>
by not having been alive when the Dunciad was written.
Beauclerk used his name as a proverbial expression for a bore.
He was the laughing-stock of the whole of that brilliant society
which has owed to him the greater part of its fame. He was
always laying himself at the feet of some eminent man, and  <span class="linenum">20</span>
begging to be spit upon and trampled upon. He was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>earning some ridiculous nickname, and then "binding it as a
crown unto him," not merely in metaphor, but literally. He
exhibited himself, at the Shakspeare Jubilee, to all the crowd
which filled Stratford-on-Avon, with a placard round his hat
bearing the inscription of Corsica Boswell. In his Tour he
proclaimed to all the world that at Edinburgh he was known   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
by the appellation of Paoli Boswell. Servile and impertinent,
shallow and pedantic, a bigot and a sot, bloated with family
pride, and eternally blustering about the dignity of a born
gentleman, yet stooping to be a tale-bearer, an eavesdropper,
a common butt in the taverns of London, so curious to know   <span class="linenum">10</span>
every body who was talked about, that, Tory and high Churchman
as he was, he man&oelig;uvred, we have been told, for an introduction
to Tom Paine, so vain of the most childish distinctions,
that when he had been to court, he drove to the office where
his book was printing without changing his clothes, and summoned  <span class="linenum">15</span>
all the printer's devils to admire his new ruffles and
sword; such was this man, and such he was content and proud
to be. Every thing which another man would have hidden,
every thing the publication of which would have made another
man hang himself, was matter of gay and clamorous exultation  <span class="linenum">20</span>
to his weak and diseased mind. What silly things he said,
what bitter retorts he provoked, how at one place he was
troubled with evil presentiments which came to nothing, how
at another place, on waking from a drunken doze, he read the
prayerbook and took a hair of the dog that had bitten him,   <span class="linenum">25</span>
how he went to see men hanged and came away maudlin, how
he added five hundred pounds to the fortune of one of his babies
because she was not scared at Johnson's ugly face, how he was
frightened out of his wits at sea, and how the sailors quieted
him as they would have quieted a child, how tipsy he was at  <span class="linenum">30</span>
Lady Cork's one evening and how much his merriment annoyed
the ladies, how impertinent he was to the Duchess of Argyle
and with what stately contempt she put down his impertinence,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>how Colonel Macleod sneered to his face at his impudent
obtrusiveness, how his father and the very wife of his bosom
laughed and fretted at his fooleries; all these things he proclaimed
to all the world, as if they had been subjects for pride
and ostentatious rejoicing. All the caprices of his temper, all
the illusions of his vanity, all his hypochondriac whimsies, all  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
his castles in the air, he displayed with a cool self-complacency,
a perfect unconsciousness that he was making a fool of himself,
to which it is impossible to find a parallel in the whole history
of mankind. He has used many people ill; but assuredly
he has used nobody so ill as himself.  <span class="linenum">10</span></p>

<p>3. That such a man should have written one of the best
books in the world is strange enough. But this is not all.
Many persons who have conducted themselves foolishly in
active life, and whose conversation has indicated no superior
powers of mind, have left us valuable works. Goldsmith was   <span class="linenum">15</span>
very justly described by one of his contemporaries as an
inspired idiot, and by another as a being</p>

<p class="center">"Who wrote like an angel, and talked like poor Poll."</p>

<p class="in0">La Fontaine was in society a mere simpleton. His blunders
would not come in amiss among the stories of Hierocles. But   <span class="linenum">20</span>
these men attained literary eminence in spite of their weaknesses.
Boswell attained it by reason of his weaknesses. If
he had not been a great fool, he would never have been a
great writer. Without all the qualities which made him the
jest and the torment of those among whom he lived, without   <span class="linenum">25</span>
the officiousness, the inquisitiveness, the effrontery, the
toad-eating, the insensibility to all reproof, he never could have
produced so excellent a book. He was a slave, proud of his
servitude, a Paul Pry, convinced that his own curiosity and
garrulity were virtues, an unsafe companion who never scrupled   <span class="linenum">30</span>
to repay the most liberal hospitality by the basest violation of
confidence, a man without delicacy, without shame, without
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>sense enough to know when he was hurting the feelings of
others or when he was exposing himself to derision; and
because he was all this, he has, in an important department
of literature, immeasurably surpassed such writers as Tacitus,
Clarendon, Alfieri, and his own idol Johnson.</p>

<p>4. Of the talents which ordinarily raise men to eminence   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
as writers, Boswell had absolutely none. There is not in all
his books a single remark of his own on literature, politics,
religion, or society, which is not either commonplace or absurd.
His dissertations on hereditary gentility, on the slave-trade,
and on the entailing of landed estates, may serve as examples.  <span class="linenum">10</span>
To say that these passages are sophistical would be to pay
them an extravagant compliment. They have no pretence to
argument, or even to meaning. He has reported innumerable
observations made by himself in the course of conversation.
Of those observations we do not remember one which is above   <span class="linenum">15</span>
the intellectual capacity of a boy of fifteen. He has printed
many of his own letters, and in these letters he is always ranting
or twaddling. Logic, eloquence, wit, taste, all those things
which are generally considered as making a book valuable, were
utterly wanting to him. He had, indeed, a quick observation  <span class="linenum">20</span>
and a retentive memory. These qualities, if he had been a
man of sense and virtue, would scarcely of themselves have sufficed
to make him conspicuous; but, because he was a dunce,
a parasite, and a coxcomb, they have made him immortal.</p>

<p>5. Those parts of his book which, considered abstractedly,  <span class="linenum">25</span>
are most utterly worthless, are delightful when we read them
as illustrations of the character of the writer. Bad in themselves,
they are good dramatically, like the nonsense of Justice
Shallow, the clipped English of Dr. Caius, or the misplaced
consonants of Fluellen. Of all confessors, Boswell is the most  <span class="linenum">30</span>
candid. Other men who have pretended to lay open their
own hearts, Rousseau, for example, and Lord Byron, have
evidently written with a constant view to effect, and are to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>then most distrusted when they seem to be most sincere.
There is scarcely any man who would not rather accuse himself
of great crimes and of dark and tempestuous passions,
than proclaim all his little vanities and wild fancies. It would
be easier to find a person who would avow actions like those
of Cæsar Borgia or Danton, than one who would publish a   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
daydream like those of Alnaschar and Malvolio. Those weaknesses
which most men keep covered up in the most secret
places of the mind, not to be disclosed to the eye of friendship
or of love, were precisely the weaknesses which Boswell
paraded before all the world. He was perfectly frank, because  <span class="linenum">10</span>
the weakness of his understanding and the tumult of his spirits
prevented him from knowing when he made himself ridiculous.
His book resembles nothing so much as the conversation of
the inmates of the Palace of Truth.</p>

<p>6. His fame is great; and it will, we have no doubt, be   <span class="linenum">15</span>
lasting; but it is fame of a peculiar kind, and indeed marvellously
resembles infamy. We remember no other case in
which the world has made so great a distinction between a
book and its author. In general, the book and the author
are considered as one. To admire the book is to admire the   <span class="linenum">20</span>
author. The case of Boswell is an exception, we think the
only exception, to this rule. His work is universally allowed
to be interesting, instructive, eminently original: yet it has
brought him nothing but contempt. All the world reads it:
all the world delights in it: yet we do not remember ever to  <span class="linenum">25</span>
have read or ever to have heard any expression of respect and
admiration for the man to whom we owe so much instruction
and amusement. While edition after edition of his book was
coming forth, his son, as Mr. Croker tells us, was ashamed of
it, and hated to hear it mentioned. This feeling was natural  <span class="linenum">30</span>
and reasonable. Sir Alexander saw that, in proportion to the
celebrity of the work, was the degradation of the author. The
very editors of this unfortunate gentleman's books have forgotten
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>their allegiance, and, like those Puritan casuists who
took arms by the authority of the king against his person,
have attacked the writer while doing homage to the writings.
Mr. Croker, for example, has published two thousand five
hundred notes on the life of Johnson, and yet scarcely ever
mentions the biographer whose performance he has taken such  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
pains to illustrate without some expression of contempt.</p>

<p>7. An ill-natured man Boswell certainly was not. Yet the
malignity of the most malignant satirist could scarcely cut
deeper than his thoughtless loquacity. Having himself no
sensibility to derision and contempt, he took it for granted  <span class="linenum">10</span>
that all others were equally callous. He was not ashamed to
exhibit himself to the whole world as a common spy, a common
tattler, a humble companion without the excuse of poverty,
and to tell a hundred stories of his own pertness and
folly, and of the insults which his pertness and folly brought  <span class="linenum">15</span>
upon him. It was natural that he should show little discretion
in cases in which the feelings or the honour of others
might be concerned. No man, surely, ever published such
stories respecting persons whom he professed to love and
revere. He would infallibly have made his hero as contemptible  <span class="linenum">20</span>
as he has made himself, had not his hero really
possessed some moral and intellectual qualities of a very high
order. The best proof that Johnson was really an extraordinary
man is that his character, instead of being degraded, has,
on the whole, been decidedly raised by a work in which all   <span class="linenum">25</span>
his vices and weaknesses are exposed more unsparingly than
they ever were exposed by Churchill or by Kenrick.</p>

<p>8. Johnson grown old, Johnson in the fulness of his fame
and in the enjoyment of a competent fortune, is better known
to us than any other man in history. Every thing about him, <span class="linenum">30</span>
his coat, his wig, his figure, his face, his scrofula, his St. Vitus's
dance, his rolling walk, his blinking eye, the outward signs
which too clearly marked his approbation of his dinner, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>insatiable appetite for fish-sauce and veal-pie with plums, his
inextinguishable thirst for tea, his trick of touching the posts
as he walked, his mysterious practice of treasuring up scraps of
orange-peel, his morning slumbers, his midnight disputations,
his contortions, his mutterings, his gruntings, his puffings,
his vigorous, acute, and ready eloquence, his sarcastic wit, his  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
vehemence, his insolence, his fits of tempestuous rage, his
queer inmates, old Mr. Levett and blind Mrs. Williams, the cat
Hodge and the negro Frank, all are as familiar to us as the
objects by which we have been surrounded from childhood.
But we have no minute information respecting those years of   <span class="linenum">10</span>
Johnson's life during which his character and his manners
became immutably fixed. We know him, not as he was known
to the men of his own generation, but as he was known to men
whose father he might have been. That celebrated club of
which he was the most distinguished member contained few  <span class="linenum">15</span>
persons who could remember a time when his fame was not
fully established and his habits completely formed. He had
made himself a name in literature while Reynolds and the
Wartons were still boys. He was about twenty years older
than Burke, Goldsmith, and Gerard Hamilton, about thirty   <span class="linenum">20</span>
years older than Gibbon, Beauclerk, and Langton, and about
forty years older than Lord Stowell, Sir William Jones, and
Windham. Boswell and Mrs. Thrale, the two writers from
whom we derive most of our knowledge respecting him, never
saw him till long after he was fifty years old, till most of his  <span class="linenum">25</span>
great works had become classical, and till the pension bestowed
on him by the Crown had placed him above poverty. Of those
eminent men who were his most intimate associates towards the
close of his life, the only one, as far as we remember, who knew
him during the first ten or twelve years of his residence in the  <span class="linenum">30</span>
capital, was David Garrick; and it does not appear that, during
those years, David Garrick saw much of his fellow-townsman.</p>

<p>9. Johnson came up to London precisely at the time when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>the condition of a man of letters was most miserable and
degraded. It was a dark night between two sunny days. The
age of patronage had passed away. The age of general curiosity
and intelligence had not arrived. The number of readers
is at present so great that a popular author may subsist in
comfort and opulence on the profits of his works. In the  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
reigns of William the Third, of Anne, and of George the First,
even such men as Congreve and Addison would scarcely have
been able to live like gentlemen by the mere sale of their
writings. But the deficiency of the natural demand for literature
was, at the close of the seventeenth and at the beginning   <span class="linenum">10</span>
of the eighteenth century, more than made up by artificial
encouragement, by a vast system of bounties and premiums.
There was, perhaps, never a time at which the rewards of
literary merit were so splendid, at which men who could write
well found such easy admittance into the most distinguished  <span class="linenum">15</span>
society, and to the highest honours of the state. The chiefs
of both the great parties into which the kingdom was divided
patronised literature with emulous munificence. Congreve,
when he had scarcely attained his majority, was rewarded for
his first comedy with places which made him independent for  <span class="linenum">20</span>
life. Smith, though his Hippolytus and Phædra failed, would
have been consoled with three hundred a year but for his own
folly. Rowe was not only Poet Laureate, but also land-surveyor
of the customs in the port of London, clerk of the council to
the Prince of Wales, and secretary of the Presentations to the  <span class="linenum">25</span>
Lord Chancellor. Hughes was secretary to the Commissions
of the Peace. Ambrose Philips was judge of the Prerogative
Court in Ireland. Locke was Commissioner of Appeals and
of the Board of Trade. Newton was Master of the Mint.
Stepney and Prior were employed in embassies of high dignity   <span class="linenum">30</span>
and importance. Gay, who commenced life as an apprentice
to a silk mercer, became a secretary of legation at five-and-twenty.
It was to a poem on the Death of Charles the Second,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>and to the City and Country Mouse, that Montague owed
his introduction into public life, his earldom, his garter, and
his Auditorship of the Exchequer. Swift, but for the unconquerable
prejudice of the queen, would have been a bishop.
Oxford, with his white staff in his hand, passed through the
crowd of his suitors to welcome Parnell, when that ingenious  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
writer deserted the Whigs. Steele was a commissioner of
stamps and a member of Parliament. Arthur Mainwaring was
a commissioner of the customs, and auditor of the imprest.
Tickell was secretary to the Lords Justices of Ireland. Addison
was secretary of state.   <span class="linenum">10</span></p>

<p>10. This liberal patronage was brought into fashion, as it
seems, by the magnificent Dorset, almost the only noble versifier
in the court of Charles the Second who possessed talents
for composition which were independent of the aid of a coronet.
Montague owed his elevation to the favour of Dorset, and   <span class="linenum">15</span>
imitated through the whole course of his life the liberality to
which he was himself so greatly indebted. The Tory leaders,
Harley and Bolingbroke in particular, vied with the chiefs of
the Whig party in zeal for the encouragement of letters. But
soon after the accession of the House of Hanover a change   <span class="linenum">20</span>
took place. The supreme power passed to a man who cared
little for poetry or eloquence. The importance of the House
of Commons was constantly on the increase. The government
was under the necessity of bartering for Parliamentary support
much of that patronage which had been employed in fostering   <span class="linenum">25</span>
literary merit; and Walpole was by no means inclined to
divert any part of the fund of corruption to purposes which he
considered as idle. He had eminent talents for government
and for debate. But he had paid little attention to books,
and felt little respect for authors. One of the coarse jokes of  <span class="linenum">30</span>
his friend, Sir Charles Hanbury Williams, was far more pleasing
to him than Thomson's Seasons or Richardson's Pamela.
He had observed that some of the distinguished writers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>whom the favour of Halifax had turned into statesmen had
been mere encumbrances to their party, dawdlers in office,
and mutes in Parliament. During the whole course of his
administration, therefore, he scarcely befriended a single man
of genius. The best writers of the age gave all their support
to the opposition, and contributed to excite that discontent  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
which, after plunging the nation into a foolish and unjust war,
overthrew the minister to make room for men less able and
equally immoral. The opposition could reward its eulogists
with little more than promises and caresses. St. James's would
give nothing: Leicester House had nothing to give.  <span class="linenum">10</span></p>

<p>11. Thus, at the time when Johnson commenced his literary
career, a writer had little to hope from the patronage of
powerful individuals. The patronage of the public did not
yet furnish the means of comfortable subsistence. The prices
paid by booksellers to authors were so low that a man of  <span class="linenum">15</span>
considerable talents and unremitting industry could do little more
than provide for the day which was passing over him. The
lean kine had eaten up the fat kine. The thin and withered
ears had devoured the good ears. The season of rich harvests
was over, and the period of famine had begun. All that is  <span class="linenum">20</span>
squalid and miserable might now be summed up in the word
Poet. That word denoted a creature dressed like a scarecrow,
familiar with compters and spunging-houses, and perfectly
qualified to decide on the comparative merits of the Common
Side in the King's Bench prison and of Mount Scoundrel   <span class="linenum">25</span>
in the Fleet. Even the poorest pitied him; and they well
might pity him. For if their condition was equally abject,
their aspirings were not equally high, nor their sense of
insult equally acute. To lodge in a garret up four pair of
stairs, to dine in a cellar among footmen out of place, to  <span class="linenum">30</span>
translate ten hours a day for the wages of a ditcher, to be hunted
by bailiffs from one haunt of beggary and pestilence to another,
from Grub Street to St. George's Fields, and from St. George's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>Fields to the alleys behind St. Martin's church, to sleep on a
bulk in June and amidst the ashes of a glass-house in December,
to die in a hospital and to be buried in a parish vault,
was the fate of more than one writer who, if he had lived
thirty years earlier, would have been admitted to the sittings
of the Kitcat or the Scriblerus club, would have sat in Parliament, <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
and would have been intrusted with embassies to the
High Allies; who, if he had lived in our time, would have
found encouragement scarcely less munificent in Albemarle
Street or in Paternoster Row.</p>

<p>12. As every climate has its peculiar diseases, so every walk  <span class="linenum">10</span>
of life has its peculiar temptations. The literary character,
assuredly, has always had its share of faults, vanity, jealousy,
morbid sensibility. To these faults were now superadded the
faults which are commonly found in men whose livelihood is
precarious, and whose principles are exposed to the trial of  <span class="linenum">15</span>
severe distress. All the vices of the gambler and of the beggar
were blended with those of the author. The prizes in the
wretched lottery of book-making were scarcely less ruinous than
the blanks. If good fortune came, it came in such a manner
that it was almost certain to be abused. After months of   <span class="linenum">20</span>
starvation and despair, a full third night or a well-received
dedication filled the pocket of the lean, ragged, unwashed
poet with guineas. He hastened to enjoy those luxuries with
the images of which his mind had been haunted while he
was sleeping amidst the cinders and eating potatoes at the   <span class="linenum">25</span>
Irish ordinary in Shoe Lane. A week of taverns soon qualified
him for another year of night-cellars. Such was the life
of Savage, of Boyse, and of a crowd of others. Sometimes
blazing in gold-laced hats and waistcoats; sometimes lying in
bed because their coats had gone to pieces, or wearing paper   <span class="linenum">30</span>
cravats because their linen was in pawn; sometimes drinking
Champagne and Tokay with Betty Careless; sometimes
standing at the window of an eating-house in Porridge island,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>to snuff up the scent of what they could not afford to taste;
they knew luxury; they knew beggary; but they never knew
comfort. These men were irreclaimable. They looked on a
regular and frugal life with the same aversion which an old
gipsy or a Mohawk hunter feels for a stationary abode, and for
the restraints and securities of civilised communities. They  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
were as untameable, as much wedded to their desolate freedom,
as the wild ass. They could no more be broken in to
the offices of social man than the unicorn could be trained to
serve and abide by the crib. It was well if they did not, like
beasts of a still fiercer race, tear the hands which ministered  <span class="linenum">10</span>
to their necessities. To assist them was impossible; and the
most benevolent of mankind at length became weary of giving
relief which was dissipated with the wildest profusion as soon
as it had been received. If a sum was bestowed on the
wretched adventurer, such as, properly husbanded, might  <span class="linenum">15</span>
have supplied him for six months, it was instantly spent in
strange freaks of sensuality, and before forty-eight hours had
elapsed, the poet was again pestering all his acquaintance for
twopence to get a plate of shin of beef at a subterraneous
cook-shop. If his friends gave him an asylum in their houses,  <span class="linenum">20</span>
those houses were forthwith turned into bagnios and taverns.
All order was destroyed; all business was suspended. The
most good-natured host began to repent of his eagerness to
serve a man of genius in distress when he heard his guest
roaring for fresh punch at five o'clock in the morning.  <span class="linenum">25</span></p>

<p>13. A few eminent writers were more fortunate. Pope had
been raised above poverty by the active patronage which, in
his youth, both the great political parties had extended to his
Homer. Young had received the only pension ever bestowed,
to the best of our recollection, by Sir Robert Walpole, as the  <span class="linenum">30</span>
reward of mere literary merit. One or two of the many poets
who attached themselves to the opposition, Thomson in particular
and Mallet, obtained, after much severe suffering, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>means of subsistence from their political friends. Richardson,
like a man of sense, kept his shop; and his shop kept him,
which his novels, admirable as they are, would scarcely have
done. But nothing could be more deplorable than the state
even of the ablest men, who at that time depended for subsistence
on their writings. Johnson, Collins, Fielding, and  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
Thomson, were certainly four of the most distinguished persons
that England produced during the eighteenth century.
It is well known that they were all four arrested for debt.</p>

<p>14. Into calamities and difficulties such as these Johnson
plunged in his twenty-eighth year. From that time till he was  <span class="linenum">10</span>
three or four and fifty, we have little information respecting
him; little, we mean, compared with the full and accurate
information which we possess respecting his proceedings and
habits towards the close of his life. He emerged at length
from cock-lofts and sixpenny ordinaries into the society of the   <span class="linenum">15</span>
polished and the opulent. His fame was established. A pension
sufficient for his wants had been conferred on him: and
he came forth to astonish a generation with which he had
almost as little in common as with Frenchmen or Spaniards.</p>

<p>15. In his early years he had occasionally seen the great;  <span class="linenum">20</span>
but he had seen them as a beggar. He now came among
them as a companion. The demand for amusement and
instruction had, during the course of twenty years, been gradually
increasing. The price of literary labour had risen; and
those rising men of letters with whom Johnson was henceforth   <span class="linenum">25</span>
to associate were for the most part persons widely different
from those who had walked about with him all night in the
streets for want of a lodging. Burke, Robertson, the Wartons,
Gray, Mason, Gibbon, Adam Smith, Beattie, Sir William
Jones, Goldsmith, and Churchill, were the most distinguished  <span class="linenum">30</span>
writers of what may be called the second generation of the
Johnsonian age. Of these men Churchill was the only one
in whom we can trace the stronger lineaments of that character
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>which, when Johnson first came up to London, was common
among authors. Of the rest, scarcely any had felt the pressure
of severe poverty. Almost all had been early admitted
into the most respectable society on an equal footing. They
were men of quite a different species from the dependents of
Curll and Osborne.  <span class="linenum in1">5</span></p>

<p>16. Johnson came among them the solitary specimen of
a past age, the last survivor of the genuine race of Grub
Street hacks; the last of that generation of authors whose
abject misery and whose dissolute manners had furnished
inexhaustible matter to the satirical genius of Pope. From   <span class="linenum">10</span>
nature he had received an uncouth figure, a diseased constitution,
and an irritable temper. The manner in which the
earlier years of his manhood had been passed had given to
his demeanour, and even to his moral character, some peculiarities
appalling to the civilised beings who were the companions  <span class="linenum">15</span>
of his old age. The perverse irregularity of his hours,
the slovenliness of his person, his fits of strenuous exertion,
interrupted by long intervals of sluggishness, his strange abstinence,
and his equally strange voracity, his active benevolence,
contrasted with the constant rudeness and the occasional   <span class="linenum">20</span>
ferocity of his manners in society, made him, in the opinion
of those with whom he lived during the last twenty years of
his life, a complete original. An original he was, undoubtedly,
in some respects. But if we possessed full information
concerning those who shared his early hardships, we should   <span class="linenum">25</span>
probably find that what we call his singularities of manner
were, for the most part, failings which he had in common
with the class to which he belonged. He ate at Streatham
Park as he had been used to eat behind the screen at
St. John's Gate, when he was ashamed to show his ragged   <span class="linenum">30</span>
clothes. He ate as it was natural that a man should eat, who,
during a great part of his life, had passed the morning in
doubt whether he should have food for the afternoon. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>habits of his early life had accustomed him to bear privation
with fortitude, but not to taste pleasure with moderation.
He could fast; but, when he did not fast, he tore his dinner
like a famished wolf, with the veins swelling on his forehead,
and the perspiration running down his cheeks. He
scarcely ever took wine. But when he drank it, he drank it  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
greedily and in large tumblers. These were, in fact, mitigated
symptoms of that same moral disease which raged with such
deadly malignity in his friends Savage and Boyse. The
roughness and violence which he showed in society were to
be expected from a man whose temper, not naturally gentle,   <span class="linenum">10</span>
had been long tried by the bitterest calamities, by the want
of meat, of fire, and of clothes, by the importunity of creditors,
by the insolence of booksellers, by the derision of fools,
by the insincerity of patrons, by that bread which is the
bitterest of all food, by those stairs which are the most toilsome  <span class="linenum">15</span>
of all paths, by that deferred hope which makes the
heart sick. Through all these things the ill-dressed, coarse,
ungainly pedant had struggled manfully up to eminence and
command. It was natural that, in the exercise of his power,
he should be "eo immitior, quia toleraverat," that, though his  <span class="linenum">20</span>
heart was undoubtedly generous and humane, his demeanour
in society should be harsh and despotic. For severe distress
he had sympathy, and not only sympathy, but munificent
relief. But for the suffering which a harsh world inflicts
upon a delicate mind he had no pity; for it was a kind of  <span class="linenum">25</span>
suffering which he could scarcely conceive. He would carry
home on his shoulders a sick and starving girl from the
streets. He turned his house into a place of refuge for a
crowd of wretched old creatures who could find no other
asylum; nor could all their peevishness and ingratitude weary  <span class="linenum">30</span>
out his benevolence. But the pangs of wounded vanity
seemed to him ridiculous; and he scarcely felt sufficient
compassion even for the pangs of wounded affection. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>had seen and felt so much of sharp misery, that he was not
affected by paltry vexations; and he seemed to think that
every body ought to be as much hardened to those vexations
as himself. He was angry with Boswell for complaining of
a headache, with Mrs. Thrale for grumbling about the dust
on the road, or the smell of the kitchen. These were, in  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
his phrase, "foppish lamentations," which people ought to
be ashamed to utter in a world so full of sin and sorrow.
Goldsmith crying because the Good-natured Man had failed,
inspired him with no pity. Though his own health was not
good, he detested and despised valetudinarians. Pecuniary   <span class="linenum">10</span>
losses, unless they reduced the loser absolutely to beggary,
moved him very little. People whose hearts had been softened
by prosperity might weep, he said, for such events; but
all that could be expected of a plain man was not to laugh.
He was not much moved even by the spectacle of Lady   <span class="linenum">15</span>
Tavistock dying of a broken heart for the loss of her lord.
Such grief he considered as a luxury reserved for the idle and
the wealthy. A washerwoman, left a widow with nine small
children, would not have sobbed herself to death.</p>

<p>17. A person who troubled himself so little about small  <span class="linenum">20</span>
or sentimental grievances was not likely to be very attentive
to the feelings of others in the ordinary intercourse of society.
He could not understand how a sarcasm or a reprimand
could make any man really unhappy. "My dear doctor,"
said he to Goldsmith, "what harm does it do to a man to call  <span class="linenum">25</span>
him Holofernes?" "Pooh, ma'am," he exclaimed to Mrs.
Carter, "who is the worse for being talked of uncharitably?"
Politeness has been well defined as benevolence in small
things. Johnson was impolite, not because he wanted benevolence,
but because small things appeared smaller to him than   <span class="linenum">30</span>
to people who had never known what it was to live for fourpence
halfpenny a day.</p>

<p>18. The characteristic peculiarity of his intellect was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>union of great powers with low prejudices. If we judged of
him by the best parts of his mind, we should place him almost
as high as he was placed by the idolatry of Boswell; if by
the worst parts of his mind, we should place him even below
Boswell himself. Where he was not under the influence of
some strange scruple, or some domineering passion, which  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
prevented him from boldly and fairly investigating a subject,
he was a wary and acute reasoner, a little too much inclined
to scepticism, and a little too fond of paradox. No man was
less likely to be imposed upon by fallacies in argument or by
exaggerated statements of fact. But if, while he was beating  <span class="linenum">10</span>
down sophisms and exposing false testimony, some childish
prejudices, such as would excite laughter in a well-managed
nursery, came across him, he was smitten as if by enchantment.
His mind dwindled away under the spell from gigantic
elevation to dwarfish littleness. Those who had lately been   <span class="linenum">15</span>
admiring its amplitude and its force were now as much astonished
at its strange narrowness and feebleness as the fisherman
in the Arabian tale, when he saw the Genie, whose stature
had overshadowed the whole sea-coast, and whose might
seemed equal to a contest with armies, contract himself to  <span class="linenum">20</span>
the dimensions of his small prison, and lie there the helpless
slave of the charm of Solomon.</p>

<p>19. Johnson was in the habit of sifting with extreme severity
the evidence for all stories which were merely odd. But when
they were not only odd but miraculous, his severity relaxed.  <span class="linenum">25</span>
He began to be credulous precisely at the point where the
most credulous people begin to be sceptical. It is curious to
observe, both in his writings and in his conversation, the contrast
between the disdainful manner in which he rejects unauthenticated
anecdotes, even when they are consistent with the   <span class="linenum">30</span>
general laws of nature, and the respectful manner in which he
mentions the wildest stories relating to the invisible world.
A man who told him of a waterspout or a meteoric stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>generally had the lie direct given him for his pains. A man
who told him of a prediction or a dream wonderfully accomplished
was sure of a courteous hearing. "Johnson," observed
Hogarth, "like king David, says in his haste that all men are
liars." "His incredulity," says Mrs. Thrale, "amounted almost
to disease." She tells us how he browbeat a gentleman, who  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
gave him an account of a hurricane in the West Indies, and a
poor quaker who related some strange circumstance about the
red-hot balls fired at the siege of Gibraltar. "It is not so.
It cannot be true. Don't tell that story again. You cannot
think how poor a figure you make in telling it." He once said,  <span class="linenum">10</span>
half jestingly we suppose, that for six months he refused to
credit the fact of the earthquake at Lisbon, and that he still
believed the extent of the calamity to be greatly exaggerated.
Yet he related with a grave face how old Mr. Cave of St. John's
Gate saw a ghost, and how this ghost was something of a shadowy  <span class="linenum">15</span>
being. He went himself on a ghost hunt to Cock Lane, and
was angry with John Wesley for not following up another scent
of the same kind with proper spirit and perseverance. He rejects
the Celtic genealogies and poems without the least hesitation;
yet he declares himself willing to believe the stories of   <span class="linenum">20</span>
the second sight. If he had examined the claims of the Highland
seers with half the severity with which he sifted the evidence
for the genuineness of Fingal, he would, we suspect, have
come away from Scotland with a mind fully made up. In his
Lives of the Poets, we find that he is unwilling to give credit  <span class="linenum">25</span>
to the accounts of Lord Roscommon's early proficiency in his
studies; but he tells with great solemnity an absurd romance
about some intelligence preternaturally impressed on the mind
of that nobleman. He avows himself to be in great doubt
about the truth of the story, and ends by warning his readers  <span class="linenum">30</span>
not wholly to slight such impressions.</p>

<p>20. Many of his sentiments on religious subjects are worthy
of a liberal and enlarged mind. He could discern clearly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>enough the folly and meanness of all bigotry except his own.
When he spoke of the scruples of the Puritans, he spoke like
a person who had really obtained an insight into the divine
philosophy of the New Testament, and who considered Christianity
as a noble scheme of government, tending to promote
the happiness and to elevate the moral nature of man. The   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
horror which the sectaries felt for cards, Christmas ale,
plum-porridge, mince-pies, and dancing-bears, excited his contempt.
To the arguments urged by some very worthy people against
showy dress he replied with admirable sense and spirit, "Let
us not be found, when our Master calls us, stripping the lace   <span class="linenum">10</span>
off our waistcoats, but the spirit of contention from our souls
and tongues. Alas! sir, the man who cannot get to heaven in
a green coat will not find his way thither the sooner in a grey
one." Yet he was himself under the tyranny of scruples as
unreasonable as those of Hudibras or Ralpho, and carried his   <span class="linenum">15</span>
zeal for ceremonies and for ecclesiastical dignities to lengths
altogether inconsistent with reason or with Christian charity.
He has gravely noted down in his diary that he once committed
the sin of drinking coffee on Good Friday. In Scotland, he
thought it his duty to pass several months without joining in   <span class="linenum">20</span>
public worship, solely because the ministers of the kirk had not
been ordained by bishops. His mode of estimating the piety
of his neighbours was somewhat singular. "Campbell," said
he, "is a good man, a pious man. I am afraid he has not
been in the inside of a church for many years; but he never   <span class="linenum">25</span>
passes a church without pulling off his hat: this shows he has
good principles." Spain and Sicily must surely contain many
pious robbers and well-principled assassins. Johnson could
easily see that a Roundhead who named all his children after
Solomon's singers, and talked in the House of Commons about  <span class="linenum">30</span>
seeking the Lord, might be an unprincipled villain whose religious
mummeries only aggravated his guilt. But a man who
took off his hat when he passed a church episcopally consecrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>must be a good man, a pious man, a man of good principles.
Johnson could easily see that those persons who looked on
a dance or a laced waistcoat as sinful, deemed most ignobly
of the attributes of God and of the ends of revelation. But
with what a storm of invective he would have overwhelmed
any man who had blamed him for celebrating the redemption  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
of mankind with sugarless tea and butterless buns.</p>

<p>21. Nobody spoke more contemptuously of the cant of
patriotism. Nobody saw more clearly the error of those who
regarded liberty, not as a means, but as an end, and who
proposed to themselves, as the object of their pursuit, the  <span class="linenum">10</span>
prosperity of the state as distinct from the prosperity of the
individuals who compose the state. His calm and settled opinion
seems to have been that forms of government have little or no
influence on the happiness of society. This opinion, erroneous
as it is, ought at least to have preserved him from all  <span class="linenum">15</span>
intemperance on political questions. It did not, however, preserve
him from the lowest, fiercest, and most absurd extravagances of
party-spirit, from rants which, in every thing but the diction,
resembled those of Squire Western. He was, as a politician,
half ice and half fire. On the side of his intellect he was a   <span class="linenum">20</span>
mere Pococurante, far too apathetic about public affairs, far too
sceptical as to the good or evil tendency of any form of polity.
His passions, on the contrary, were violent even to slaying
against all who leaned to Whiggish principles. The well-known
lines which he inserted in Goldsmith's Traveller express   <span class="linenum">25</span>
what seems to have been his deliberate judgment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<div class="i0">"How small of all that human hearts endure</div>
<div class="i0">That part which kings or laws can cause or cure!"</div>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">He had previously put expressions very similar into the mouth
of Rasselas. It is amusing to contrast these passages with the  <span class="linenum">30</span>
torrents of raving abuse which he poured forth against the
Long Parliament and the American Congress. In one of the
conversations reported by Boswell this inconsistency displays
itself in the most ludicrous manner.</p>

<p>22. "Sir Adam Ferguson," says Boswell, "suggested that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
luxury corrupts a people, and destroys the spirit of liberty.
<span class="smcap">Johnson</span>: 'Sir, that is all visionary. I would not give half
a guinea to live under one form of government rather than
another. It is of no moment to the happiness of an individual.  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
Sir, the danger of the abuse of power is nothing to a private
man. What Frenchman is prevented passing his life as he
pleases?' <span class="smcap">Sir Adam</span>: 'But, sir, in the British constitution it
is surely of importance to keep up a spirit in the people, so as
to preserve a balance against the crown.' <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>: 'Sir, I  <span class="linenum">10</span>
perceive you are a vile Whig. Why all this childish jealousy of
the power of the crown? The crown has not power enough.'"</p>

<p>23. One of the old philosophers, Lord Bacon tells us, used
to say that life and death were just the same to him. "Why,
then," said an objector, "do you not kill yourself?" The   <span class="linenum">15</span>
philosopher answered, "Because it is just the same." If
the difference between two forms of government be not
worth half a guinea, it is not easy to see how Whiggism can
be viler than Toryism, or how the crown can have too little
power. If the happiness of individuals is not affected by   <span class="linenum">20</span>
political abuses, zeal for liberty is doubtless ridiculous. But
zeal for monarchy must be equally so. No person would
have been more quick-sighted than Johnson to such a contradiction
as this in the logic of an antagonist.</p>

<p>24. The judgments which Johnson passed on books were,   <span class="linenum">25</span>
in his own time, regarded with superstitious veneration, and, in
our time, are generally treated with indiscriminate contempt.
They are the judgments of a strong but enslaved understanding.
The mind of the critic was hedged round by an uninterrupted
fence of prejudices and superstitions. Within his narrow limits,  <span class="linenum">30</span>
he displayed a vigour and an activity which ought to have
enabled him to clear the barrier that confined him.</p>

<p>25. How it chanced that a man who reasoned on his premises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>so ably, should assume his premises so foolishly, is one of
the great mysteries of human nature. The same inconsistency
may be observed in the schoolmen of the middle ages.
Those writers show so much acuteness and force of mind in
arguing on their wretched data, that a modern reader is perpetually
at a loss to comprehend how such minds came by   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
such data. Not a flaw in the superstructure of the theory
which they are rearing escapes their vigilance. Yet they are
blind to the obvious unsoundness of the foundation. It is
the same with some eminent lawyers. Their legal arguments
are intellectual prodigies, abounding with the happiest analogies  <span class="linenum">10</span>
and the most refined distinctions. The principles of
their arbitrary science being once admitted, the statute-book
and the reports being once assumed as the foundations of
reasoning, these men must be allowed to be perfect masters
of logic. But if a question arises as to the postulates on which  <span class="linenum">15</span>
their whole system rests, if they are called upon to vindicate the
fundamental maxims of that system which they have passed
their lives in studying, these very men often talk the language
of savages or of children. Those who have listened to a man
of this class in his own court, and who have witnessed the skill  <span class="linenum">20</span>
with which he analyses and digests a vast mass of evidence, or
reconciles a crowd of precedents which at first sight seem
contradictory, scarcely know him again when, a few hours later,
they hear him speaking on the other side of Westminster
Hall in his capacity of legislator. They can scarcely believe  <span class="linenum">25</span>
that the paltry quirks which are faintly heard through a storm
of coughing, and which do not impose on the plainest country
gentleman, can proceed from the same sharp and vigorous
intellect which had excited their admiration under the same
roof, and on the same day.   <span class="linenum">30</span></p>

<p>26. Johnson decided literary questions like a lawyer, not
like a legislator. He never examined foundations where a
point was already ruled. His whole code of criticism rested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>on pure assumption, for which he sometimes quoted a precedent
or an authority, but rarely troubled himself to give a reason
drawn from the nature of things. He took it for granted that
the kind of poetry which flourished in his own time, which he
had been accustomed to hear praised from his childhood, and
which he had himself written with success, was the best kind  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
of poetry. In his biographical work he has repeatedly laid
it down as an undeniable proposition that during the latter
part of the seventeenth century, and the earlier part of the
eighteenth, English poetry had been in a constant progress
of improvement. Waller, Denham, Dryden, and Pope, had   <span class="linenum">10</span>
been, according to him, the great reformers. He judged of
all works of the imagination by the standard established among
his own contemporaries. Though he allowed Homer to have
been a greater man than Virgil, he seems to have thought the
Æneid a greater poem than the Iliad. Indeed he well might   <span class="linenum">15</span>
have thought so; for he preferred Pope's Iliad to Homer's.
He pronounced that, after Hoole's translation of Tasso, Fairfax's
would hardly be reprinted. He could see no merit in
our fine old English ballads, and always spoke with the most
provoking contempt of Percy's fondness for them. Of the  <span class="linenum">20</span>
great original works of imagination which appeared during
his time, Richardson's novels alone excited his admiration.
He could see little or no merit in Tom Jones, in Gulliver's
Travels, or in Tristram Shandy. To Thomson's Castle of
Indolence, he vouchsafed only a line of cold commendation,  <span class="linenum">25</span>
of commendation much colder than what he has bestowed
on the Creation of that portentous bore, Sir Richard Blackmore.
Gray was, in his dialect, a barren rascal. Churchill
was a blockhead. The contempt which he felt for the trash
of Macpherson was indeed just; but it was, we suspect,  <span class="linenum">30</span>
just by chance. He despised the Fingal for the very reason
which led many men of genius to admire it. He despised it,
not because it was essentially commonplace, but because it
had a superficial air of originality.</p>

<p>27. He was undoubtedly an excellent judge of compositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
fashioned on his own principles. But when a deeper philosophy
was required, when he undertook to pronounce judgment
on the works of those great minds which "yield homage
only to eternal laws," his failure was ignominious. He criticised  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
Pope's Epitaphs excellently. But his observations on
Shakespeare's plays and Milton's poems seem to us for the
most part as wretched as if they had been written by Rymer
himself, whom we take to have been the worst critic that
ever lived.  <span class="linenum">10</span></p>

<p>28. Some of Johnson's whims on literary subjects can be
compared only to that strange nervous feeling which made him
uneasy if he had not touched every post between the Mitre
tavern and his own lodgings. His preference of Latin epitaphs
to English epitaphs is an instance. An English epitaph, he  <span class="linenum">15</span>
said, would disgrace Smollett. He declared that he would not
pollute the walls of Westminster Abbey with an English epitaph
on Goldsmith. What reason there can be for celebrating a
British writer in Latin, which there was not for covering the
Roman arches of triumph with Greek inscriptions, or for  <span class="linenum">20</span>
commemorating the deeds of the heroes of Thermopylæ in
Egyptian hieroglyphics, we are utterly unable to imagine.</p>

<p>29. On men and manners, at least on the men and manners
of a particular place and a particular age, Johnson had
certainly looked with a most observant and discriminating eye.  <span class="linenum">25</span>
His remarks on the education of children, on marriage, on
the economy of families, on the rules of society, are always
striking, and generally sound. In his writings, indeed, the
knowledge of life which he possessed in an eminent degree is
very imperfectly exhibited. Like those unfortunate chiefs of  <span class="linenum">30</span>
the middle ages who were suffocated by their own chain-mail
and cloth of gold, his maxims perish under that load of words
which was designed for their defence and their ornament.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>But it is clear from the remains of his conversation, that he
had more of that homely wisdom which nothing but experience
and observation can give than any writer since the time
of Swift. If he had been content to write as he talked, he
might have left books on the practical art of living superior
to the Directions to Servants.   <span class="linenum in1">5</span></p>

<p>30. Yet even his remarks on society, like his remarks on
literature, indicate a mind at least as remarkable for narrowness
as for strength. He was no master of the great science
of human nature. He had studied, not the genus man, but
the species Londoner. Nobody was ever so thoroughly conversant  <span class="linenum">10</span>
with all the forms of life and all the shades of moral
and intellectual character which were to be seen from Islington
to the Thames, and from Hyde-Park corner to Mile-end green.
But his philosophy stopped at the first turnpike-gate. Of the
rural life of England he knew nothing; and he took it for   <span class="linenum">15</span>
granted that every body who lived in the country was either
stupid or miserable. "Country gentlemen," said he, "must
be unhappy; for they have not enough to keep their lives in
motion"; as if all those peculiar habits and associations which
made Fleet Street and Charing Cross the finest views in the  <span class="linenum">20</span>
world to himself had been essential parts of human nature.
Of remote countries and past times he talked with wild and
ignorant presumption. "The Athenians of the age of Demosthenes,"
he said to Mrs. Thrale, "were a people of brutes, a
barbarous people." In conversation with Sir Adam Ferguson   <span class="linenum">25</span>
he used similar language. "The boasted Athenians," he said,
"were barbarians. The mass of every people must be barbarous
where there is no printing." The fact was this: he saw that
a Londoner who could not read was a very stupid and brutal
fellow: he saw that great refinement of taste and activity of  <span class="linenum">30</span>
intellect were rarely found in a Londoner who had not read
much; and, because it was by means of books that people
acquired almost all their knowledge in the society with which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>he was acquainted, he concluded, in defiance of the strongest
and clearest evidence, that the human mind can be cultivated
by means of books alone. An Athenian citizen might possess
very few volumes; and the largest library to which he had
access might be much less valuable than Johnson's bookcase
in Bolt Court. But the Athenian might pass every morning  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
in conversation with Socrates, and might hear Pericles speak
four or five times every month. He saw the plays of Sophocles
and Aristophanes: he walked amidst the friezes of Phidias
and the paintings of Zeuxis: he knew by heart the choruses
of Æschylus: he heard the rhapsodist at the corner of the  <span class="linenum">10</span>
street reciting the Shield of Achilles or the Death of Argus:
he was a legislator, conversant with high questions of alliance,
revenue, and war: he was a soldier, trained under a liberal
and generous discipline: he was a judge, compelled every day
to weigh the effect of opposite arguments. These things were   <span class="linenum">15</span>
in themselves an education, an education eminently fitted, not,
indeed, to form exact or profound thinkers, but to give quickness
to the perceptions, delicacy to the taste, fluency to the
expression, and politeness to the manners. All this was overlooked.
An Athenian who did not improve his mind by reading   <span class="linenum">20</span>
was, in Johnson's opinion, much such a person as a
Cockney who made his mark, much such a person as black
Frank before he went to school, and far inferior to a parish
clerk or a printer's devil.</p>

<p>31. Johnson's friends have allowed that he carried to a   <span class="linenum">25</span>
ridiculous extreme his unjust contempt for foreigners. He
pronounced the French to be a very silly people, much behind
us, stupid, ignorant creatures. And this judgment he formed
after having been at Paris about a month, during which he
would not talk French, for fear of giving the natives an  <span class="linenum">30</span>
advantage over him in conversation. He pronounced them,
also, to be an indelicate people, because a French footman
touched the sugar with his fingers. That ingenious and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>amusing traveller, M. Simond, has defended his countrymen
very successfully against Johnson's accusation, and has pointed
out some English practices which, to an impartial spectator,
would seem at least as inconsistent with physical cleanliness
and social decorum as those which Johnson so bitterly reprehended.
To the sage, as Boswell loves to call him, it never   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
occurred to doubt that there must be something eternally
and immutably good in the usages to which he had been
accustomed. In fact, Johnson's remarks on society beyond
the bills of mortality, are generally of much the same kind
with those of honest Tom Dawson, the English footman in   <span class="linenum">10</span>
Dr. Moore's Zeluco. "Suppose the king of France has no
sons, but only a daughter, then, when the king dies, this here
daughter, according to that there law, cannot be made queen,
but the next near relative, provided he is a man, is made king,
and not the last king's daughter, which, to be sure, is very  <span class="linenum">15</span>
unjust. The French foot-guards are dressed in blue, and all
the marching regiments in white, which has a very foolish
appearance for soldiers; and as for blue regimentals, it is
only fit for the blue horse or the artillery."</p>

<p>32. Johnson's visit to the Hebrides introduced him to a   <span class="linenum">20</span>
state of society completely new to him; and a salutary suspicion
of his own deficiencies seems on that occasion to have
crossed his mind for the first time. He confessed, in the
last paragraph of his Journey, that his thoughts on national
manners were the thoughts of one who had seen but little, of  <span class="linenum">25</span>
one who had passed his time almost wholly in cities. This
feeling, however, soon passed away. It is remarkable that to
the last he entertained a fixed contempt for all those modes
of life and those studies which tend to emancipate the mind
from the prejudices of a particular age or a particular nation.  <span class="linenum">30</span>
Of foreign travel and of history he spoke with the fierce and
boisterous contempt of ignorance. "What does a man learn
by travelling? Is Beauclerk the better for travelling? What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>did Lord Charlemont learn in his travels, except that there
was a snake in one of the pyramids of Egypt?" History was,
in his opinion, to use the fine expression of Lord Plunkett, an
old almanack: historians could, as he conceived, claim no
higher dignity than that of almanack-makers; and his favourite
historians were those who, like Lord Hailes, aspired to no   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
higher dignity. He always spoke with contempt of Robertson.
Hume he would not even read. He affronted one of
his friends for talking to him about Catiline's conspiracy, and
declared that he never desired to hear of the Punic war again
as long as he lived.  <span class="linenum">10</span></p>

<p>33. Assuredly one fact which does not directly affect our
own interests, considered in itself, is no better worth knowing
than another fact. The fact that there is a snake in a pyramid,
or the fact that Hannibal crossed the Alps, are in themselves
as unprofitable to us as the fact that there is a green  <span class="linenum">15</span>
blind in a particular house in Threadneedle Street, or the
fact that a Mr. Smith comes into the city every morning on
the top of one of the Blackwall stages. But it is certain that
those who will not crack the shell of history will never get at
the kernel. Johnson, with hasty arrogance, pronounced the   <span class="linenum">20</span>
kernel worthless, because he saw no value in the shell. The
real use of travelling to distant countries and of studying the
annals of past times is to preserve men from the contraction
of mind which those can hardly escape whose whole communion
is with one generation and one neighbourhood, who  <span class="linenum">25</span>
arrive at conclusions by means of an induction not sufficiently
copious, and who therefore constantly confound exceptions
with rules, and accidents with essential properties. In
short, the real use of travelling and of studying history is to
keep men from being what Tom Dawson was in fiction, and   <span class="linenum">30</span>
Samuel Johnson in reality.</p>

<p>34. Johnson, as Mr. Burke most justly observed, appears
far greater in Boswell's books than in his own. His conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>appears to have been quite equal to his writings in
matter, and far superior to them in manner. When he talked,
he clothed his wit and his sense in forcible and natural expressions.
As soon as he took his pen in his hand to write for
the public, his style became systematically vicious. All his
books are written in a learned language, in a language which  <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
nobody hears from his mother or his nurse, in a language in
which nobody ever quarrels, or drives bargains, or makes love,
in a language in which nobody ever thinks. It is clear that
Johnson himself did not think in the dialect in which he
wrote. The expressions which came first to his tongue were   <span class="linenum">10</span>
simple, energetic, and picturesque. When he wrote for publication
he did his sentences out of English into Johnsonese.
His letters from the Hebrides to Mrs. Thrale are the original
of that work of which the Journey to the Hebrides is the
translation; and it is amusing to compare the two versions.  <span class="linenum">15</span>
"When we were taken up stairs," says he in one of his letters,
"a dirty fellow bounced out of the bed on which one of us
was to lie." This incident is recorded in the Journey as
follows: "Out of one of the beds on which we were to repose
started up, at our entrance, a man black as a Cyclops from   <span class="linenum">20</span>
the forge." Sometimes Johnson translated aloud. "The
Rehearsal," he said, very unjustly, "has not wit enough to
keep it sweet"; then, after a pause, "it has not vitality
enough to preserve it from putrefaction."</p>

<p>35. Mannerism is pardonable, and is sometimes even agreeable,  <span class="linenum">25</span>
when the manner, though vicious, is natural. Few readers,
for example, would be willing to part with the mannerism of
Milton or of Burke. But a mannerism which does not sit
easy on the mannerist, which has been adopted on principle,
and which can be sustained only by constant effort, is always  <span class="linenum">30</span>
offensive. And such is the mannerism of Johnson.</p>

<p>36. The characteristic faults of his style are so familiar to
all our readers, and have been so often burlesqued, that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>is almost superfluous to point them out. It is well known
that he made less use than any other eminent writer of those
strong plain words, Anglo-Saxon or Norman-French, of which
the roots lie in the inmost depths of our language; and that
he felt a vicious partiality for terms which, long after our own
speech had been fixed, were borrowed from the Greek and   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
Latin, and which therefore, even when lawfully naturalised,
must be considered as born aliens, not entitled to rank with
the king's English. His constant practice of padding out a
sentence with useless epithets, till it became as stiff as the
bust of an exquisite, his antithetical forms of expression,  <span class="linenum">10</span>
constantly employed even where there is no opposition in the
ideas expressed, his big words wasted on little things, his
harsh inversions, so widely different from those graceful and
easy inversions which give variety, spirit, and sweetness to
the expression of our great old writers, all these peculiarities  <span class="linenum">15</span>
have been imitated by his admirers and parodied by his
assailants, till the public has become sick of the subject.</p>

<p>37. Goldsmith said to him, very wittily and very justly,
"If you were to write a fable about little fishes, doctor, you
would make the little fishes talk like whales." No man surely  <span class="linenum">20</span>
ever had so little talent for personation as Johnson. Whether
he wrote in the character of a disappointed legacy-hunter or an
empty town fop, of a crazy virtuoso or a flippant coquette, he
wrote in the same pompous and unbending style. His speech,
like Sir Piercy Shafton's Euphuistic eloquence, bewrayed him  <span class="linenum">25</span>
under every disguise. Euphelia and Rhodoclea talk as finely
as Imlac the poet, or Seged, Emperor of Ethiopia. The gay
Cornelia describes her reception at the country-house of her
relations in such terms as these: "I was surprised, after the
civilities of my first reception, to find, instead of the leisure   <span class="linenum">30</span>
and tranquillity which a rural life always promises, and, if
well conducted, might always afford, a confused wildness of
care, and a tumultuous hurry of diligence, by which every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>face was clouded, and every motion agitated." The gentle
Tranquilla informs us, that she "had not passed the earlier
part of life without the flattery of courtship, and the joys of
triumph; but had danced the round of gaiety amidst the
murmurs of envy and the gratulations of applause, had been
attended from pleasure to pleasure by the great, the sprightly, <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
and the vain, and had seen her regard solicited by the
obsequiousness of gallantry, the gaiety of wit, and the timidity of
love." Surely Sir John Falstaff himself did not wear his petticoats
with a worse grace. The reader may well cry out,
with honest Sir Hugh Evans, "I like not when a 'oman has  <span class="linenum">10</span>
a great peard: I spy a great peard under her <span class="locked">muffler."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p>38. We had something more to say. But our article is
already too long; and we must close it. We would fain
part in good humour from the hero, from the biographer,
and even from the editor, who, ill as he has performed his   <span class="linenum">15</span>
task, has at least this claim to our gratitude, that he has
induced us to read Boswell's book again. As we close it, the
club-room is before us, and the table on which stands the
omelet for Nugent, and the lemons for Johnson. There are
assembled those heads which live for ever on the canvass of  <span class="linenum">20</span>
Reynolds. There are the spectacles of Burke and the tall
thin form of Langton, the courtly sneer of Beauclerk, and the
beaming smile of Garrick, Gibbon tapping his snuff-box, and
Sir Joshua with his trumpet in his ear. In the foreground is
that strange figure which is as familiar to us as the figures of  <span class="linenum">25</span>
those among whom we have been brought up, the gigantic
body, the huge massy face, seamed with the scars of disease,
the brown coat, the black worsted stockings, the grey wig
with the scorched foretop, the dirty hands, the nails bitten
and pared to the quick. We see the eyes and mouth moving   <span class="linenum">30</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>with convulsive twitches; we see the heavy form rolling; we
hear it puffing; and then comes the "Why, sir!" and the
"What then, sir?" and the "No, sir!" and the "You don't
see your way through the question, sir!"</p>

<p>39. What a singular destiny has been that of this remarkable
man! To be regarded in his own age as a classic, and   <span class="linenum in1">5</span>
in ours as a companion. To receive from his contemporaries
that full homage which men of genius have in general received
only from posterity! To be more intimately known to posterity
than other men are known to their contemporaries!
That kind of fame which is commonly the most transient is,  <span class="linenum">10</span>
in his case, the most durable. The reputation of those writings,
which he probably expected to be immortal, is every day
fading; while those peculiarities of manner and that careless
table-talk, the memory of which, he probably thought, would
die with him, are likely to be remembered as long as the  <span class="linenum">15</span>
English language is spoken in any quarter of the globe.

miserably poor, and I thought to fight my way by my literature and my

by Boswell. Although aware of what he considered the defects of
his college, Johnson loved Pembroke as long as he lived. He delighted
in boasting of its eminent graduates and would have left to it his house

when he began his Dictionary. Other dictionaries, notably Bailey's,
were in existence, but they were mere beginnings of what he had in
mind. As lists of words, with explanations of the meanings, they were
useful, but none of them could reasonably be considered a standard.
A standard Johnson's certainly was. Although no etymologist, in
general he not only gave full and clear definitions, but he chose
remarkably happy illustrations of the meanings of words. By taking
care, also, to select passages which were interesting and profitable
reading as well as elegant English, he succeeded in making probably
the most readable dictionary that has ever appeared.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mahomet the Great, first emperor of the Turks, in the year 1453 laid siege to
the city of Constantinople, then possessed by the Greeks, and, after an obstinate
resistance, took and sacked it. Among the many young women whom the commanders
thought fit to lay hands on and present to him was one named Irene,
a Greek, of incomparable beauty and such rare perfection of body and mind, that
the emperor, becoming enamored of her, neglected the care of his government
and empire for two whole years, and thereby so exasperated the Janizaries, that
they mutinied and threatened to dethrone him. To prevent this mischief, Mustapha
Bassa, a person of great credit with him, undertook to represent to him
the great danger to which he lay exposed by the indulgence of his passion: he
called to his remembrance the character, actions, and achievements of his predecessors,
and the state of his government; and, in short, so roused him from
his lethargy, that he took a horrible resolution to silence the clamors of his people
by the sacrifice of this admirable creature. Accordingly, he commanded her to
be dressed and adorned in the richest manner that she and her attendants could
devise, and against a certain hour issued orders for the nobility and leaders of
his army to attend him in the great hall of his palace. When they were all
assembled, himself appeared with great pomp and magnificence, leading his
captive by the hand, unconscious of guilt and ignorant of his design. With a
furious and menacing look, he gave the beholders to understand that he meant
to remove the cause of their discontent; but bade them first view that lady, whom
he held with his left hand, and say whether any of them, possessed of a jewel so
rare and precious, would for any cause forego her; to which they answered that
he had great reason for his affection toward her. To this the emperor replied
that he would convince them that he was yet master of himself. And having so
said, presently, with one of his hands catching the fair Greek by the hair of the
head, and drawing his falchion with the other, he, at one blow, struck off her
head, to the great terror of them all; and having so done, he said unto them,
"Now by this judge whether your emperor is able to bridle his affections or not."&mdash;Hawkins's

<p><b>17</b> <span class="nsmall">31&ndash;32.</span> Boswell considers it a strong confirmation of the truth of
Johnson's remark that "a man may write at any time if he will set himself
doggedly to it," that "notwithstanding his constitutional indolence,
his depression of spirits, and his labour in carrying on his Dictionary, he
answered the stated calls of the press twice a week from the stores of

Johnson was censured, he says in <i class="pub">Idler</i> No. 90, "He that thinks with

many of these discourses so hastily, says Boswell, that he did not even
read them over before they were printed. Boswell continues: "Sir

early laid it down as a fixed rule to do his best on every occasion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
in every company: to impart whatever he knew in the most forcible
language he could put it in; and that by constant practice, and never
suffering any careless expressions to escape him, or attempting to deliver
his thoughts without arranging them in the clearest manner, it became
habitual to him." One man who knew Johnson intimately observed
"that he always talked as if he was talking upon oath."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="sigright">February 7, 1755.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="smcap">To the Right Honourable the Earl of Chesterfield.</span></p>

<p class="in0">My Lord,</p>

<p>I have been lately informed, by the proprietor of the World, that two papers, in
which my Dictionary is recommended to the publick, were written by your Lordship.
To be so distinguished, is an honour, which, being very little accustomed
to favours from the great, I know not well how to receive, or in what terms to
acknowledge.</p>

<p>When, upon some slight encouragement, I first visited your Lordship, I was
overpowered, like the rest of mankind, by the enchantment of your address; and
could not forbear to wish that I might boast myself <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le vainqueur du vainqueur
de la terre</i>;&mdash;that I might obtain that regard for which I saw the world contending;
but I found my attendance so little encouraged that neither pride nor
modesty would suffer me to continue it. When I had once addressed your Lordship
in publick, I had exhausted all the art of pleasing which a retired and
uncourtly scholar can possess. I have done all that I could; and no man is well
pleased to have his all neglected, be it ever so little.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Seven years, my Lord, have now past, since I waited in your outward rooms
or was repulsed from your door; during which time I have been pushing on my
work through difficulties, of which it is useless to complain, and have brought it,
at last, to the verge of publication, without one act of assistance, one word of
encouragement, or one smile of favour. Such treatment I did not expect, for I
never had a Patron before.</p>

<p>The shepherd in Virgil grew at last acquainted with Love, and found him a
native of the rocks.</p>

<p>Is not a Patron, my Lord, one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling
for life in the water, and, when he has reached ground, encumbers him with help?
The notice which you have been pleased to take of my labours, had it been early,
had been kind; but it has been delayed till I am indifferent, and cannot enjoy it;
till I am solitary, and cannot impart it; till I am known, and do not want it.
I hope it is no very cynical asperity not to confess obligations where no benefit
has been received, or to be unwilling that the Publick should consider me as
owing that to a Patron, which Providence has enabled me to do for myself.</p>

<p>Having carried on my work thus far with so little obligation to any favourer
of learning, I shall not be disappointed though I should conclude it, if less be
possible, with less; for I have been long wakened from that dream of hope, in
which I once boasted myself with so much exultation,</p>

that much likewise is performed; and though no book was ever spared

inform it that the <i class="pub">English Dictionary</i> was written with little assistance of the
learned, and without any patronage of the great; not in the soft obscurities of
retirement, or under the shelter of academick bowers, but amidst inconvenience
and distraction, in sickness and in sorrow. It may repress the triumph of malignant
criticism to observe, that if our language is not here fully displayed, I have
only failed in an attempt which no human powers have hitherto completed. If
the lexicons of ancient tongues, now immutably fixed, and comprised in a few
volumes, be yet, after the toil of successive ages, inadequate and delusive; if the
aggregated knowledge, and co-operating diligence of the <i>Italian</i> academicians, did
not secure them from the censure of <i>Beni</i>; if the embodied criticks of <i>France</i>,
when fifty years had been spent upon their work, were obliged to change its
oeconomy, and give their second edition another form, I may surely be contented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
without the praise of perfection, which, if I could obtain, in this gloom of solitude,
what would it avail me? I have protracted my work till most of those whom I
wished to please have sunk into the grave, and success and miscarriage are
empty sounds: I therefore dismiss it with frigid tranquillity, having little to
fear or hope from censure or from praise.</p></div>

opportunity, turn these volumes over enough to find a few of the

<p><b>23</b> <span class="nsmall">13.</span> <b>Mrs. Lennox.</b> A woman whose literary efforts Johnson
encouraged so much as he did Mrs. Lennox's is certainly worth
looking up in the index to Boswell's <i class="pub">Johnson</i>.&mdash;<b>Mrs. Sheridan</b>, the
dramatist's mother, gave Johnson many an entertaining evening in her
home. She and her son entered heartily into the lively, stimulating
conversations he loved.</p>

Bute, "Pray, my Lord, what am I expected to do for this pension?"
he received the ready reply, "It is not given you for anything you are
to do, but for what you have done," he hesitated no longer.</p>

<p>Three hundred a year was a large sum in Johnson's eyes at that
time. Whether he wrote less than he would have written without it
may be questioned, says Mr. Hill, but he adds that probably "without
the pension he would not have lived to write the second greatest of
his works&mdash;the <i class="pub">Lives of the Poets</i>."</p>

and Boswell was Secretary for Foreign Correspondence. Look

had about him more "fun, and comical humour, and love of nonsense"
than almost anybody else she ever saw.</p>

<p><b>28</b> <span class="nsmall">23.</span> <b>Goldsmith.</b> Macaulay's article on Goldsmith in <i class="pub">The Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> is short, and so thoroughly readable that there is
no excuse for not being familiar with it. Boswell is continually giving
interesting glimpses of Dr. Oliver Goldsmith, and by taking advantage
of the index in the <i class="pub">Life of Johnson</i> one may in half an hour learn a great
deal about this remarkable man. According to Boswell, "he had
sagacity enough to cultivate assiduously the acquaintance of Johnson,
and his faculties were gradually enlarged by the contemplation of such
a model."</p>

<p><b>28</b> <span class="nsmall">24.</span> <b>Reynolds.</b> We can learn from short articles about Sir
Joshua's career, but the index to Boswell's <i class="pub">Johnson</i> will introduce us to
the good times the great portrait painter had with the great conversationalist
whom we are studying. Reynolds was the first proposer of
the Club, and "there seems to have been hardly a day," says Robina
Napier, "when these friends did not meet in the painting room or in
general society." Ruskin says, "Titian paints nobler pictures and
Vandyke had nobler subjects, but neither of them entered so subtly as
Sir Joshua did into the minor varieties of human heart and temper."
The business of his art "was not to criticise, but to observe," and for
this purpose the hours he spent at the Club might be as profitable as
those spent in his painting room. It will be interesting to make a list
of some of the most notable "subjects" Reynolds painted.&mdash;<b>Burke.</b>
Be sure to read Boswell's account of the famous Round Robin. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
make you feel better acquainted with Burke, Johnson, Reynolds, and
Goldsmith. The student will find valuable material in Professor
Lamont's edition of Burke's <i class="pub">Speech on Conciliation with America</i>, published
by Ginn &amp; Company.</p>

<p><b>28</b> <span class="nsmall">25.</span> <b>Gibbon.</b> You noticed on the <i>Round Robin</i> the autograph
of the author of <i class="pub">The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire</i>?</p>

<p><b>28</b> <span class="nsmall">26.</span> <b>Jones.</b> Sir William Henry Rich Jones was "the first English
scholar to master Sanskrit, and to recognize its importance for
comparative philology," says <i class="pub">The Century Dictionary</i>.</p>

<p><b>29</b> <span class="nsmall">9.</span> <b>Johnson's Club.</b> The Club still flourishes. Both Scott and
Macaulay belonged to it.</p>

<p><b>29</b> <span class="nsmall">14.</span> <b>James Boswell.</b> "Out of the fifteen millions that then
lived, and had bed and board, in the British Islands, this man has provided
us a greater <i>pleasure</i> than any other individual, at whose cost we
now enjoy ourselves; perhaps has done us a greater <i>service</i> than can
be specially attributed to more than two or three: yet, ungrateful that
we are, no written or spoken eulogy of James Boswell anywhere
exists; his recompense in solid pudding (so far as copyright went) was
not excessive; and as for the empty praise, it has altogether been
denied him. Men are unwiser than children; they do not know the
hand that feeds."</p>

<p>So Carlyle writes of the man; the book, he says, is "beyond any
other product of the eighteenth century"; it draws aside the curtains of
the Past and gives us a picture which changeful Time cannot harm or
hide. The picture charms generation after generation because it is
true. "It is not speaking with exaggeration, but with strict measured
sobriety, to say that this Book of Boswell's will give us more real
insight into the <i>History of England</i> during those days than twenty
other Books, falsely entitled 'Histories,' which take to themselves
that special aim.... The thing I want to see is not Redbook Lists,
and Court Calendars, and Parliamentary Registers, but the <span class="smcap">Life of
Man</span> in England: what men did, thought, suffered, enjoyed; the form,
especially the spirit, of their terrestrial existence, its outward environment,
its inward principle; <i>how</i> and <i>what</i> it was; whence it proceeded,
whither it was tending....</p>

<p>"Hence, indeed, comes it that History, which should be 'the essence
of innumerable Biographies,' will tell us, question it as we like, less
than one genuine Biography may do, pleasantly and of its own accord!"</p>

<p>Mr. Leslie Stephen says that "Macaulay's graphic description of his
absurdities, and Carlyle's more penetrating appreciation of his higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
qualities, contain all that can be said"; but the more recent testimony
of Dr. George B. Hill, in <i class="pub">Dr. Johnson, His Friends and His Critics</i>,
should count for something. Dr. Hill points out that while Macaulay
grants Boswell immortality he refuses him greatness, and calls attention
to what he considers elements of greatness. In regard to the accuracy
of a biographer who would "run half over London, in order to fix a
date correctly," he says: "That love, I might almost say that passion
for accuracy, that distinguished Boswell in so high a degree does not
belong to a mind that is either mean or feeble. Mean minds are
indifferent to truth, and feeble minds can see no importance in a date."</p>

<p><b>29</b> <span class="nsmall">27.</span> <b>Wilkes.</b> John Wilkes, a notorious politician, was imprisoned
for writing an article in which he attacked George the Third. The
liberty of the press was involved and Wilkes was released, much to the
delight of the people. For a brief summary of the Bill of Rights, see
Brewer's <i class="pub">Historic Note-book</i> or <i class="pub">A Handbook of English Political History</i>,
by Acland and Ransome.</p>

<p><b>29</b> <span class="nsmall">29.</span> <b>Whitfield.</b> Macaulay's short sentence implies, does it not,
that Whitfield (or Whitefield) was a noisy, open-air preacher among
the Calvinistic Methodists? In testing the accuracy of this inference
in <i class="pub">The Encyclopædia Britannica</i> or in Franklin's <i class="pub">Autobiography</i>, note in
what countries Whitefield preached, and where he died. Boswell
quotes Johnson's opinion of Whitefield in two places.</p>

<p><b>29</b> <span class="nsmall">30.</span> <b>In a happy hour.</b> May 16, 1763. By all means read Boswell's

these oddities. "His tricks and contortions, a subject for pity not
ridicule," says Mr. Hoste, "were ignored by the celebrated wits and
beauties who visited him in his gloomy 'den,' and by the duchesses
and other distinguished ladies who gathered 'four and five deep' around
him at fashionable assemblies, hanging on his sentences, and contended
for the nearest places to his chair."</p>

and honest, which is recommendation enough to Johnson."</p>

with all her shining brass-pans, waxed tables, well-filled larder-shelves;
her cooks, and bootjacks, and errand-boys, and watery-mouthed
hangers-on? Gone! Gone! The becking waiter, that with wreathed
smiles was wont to spread for Samuel and Bozzy their 'supper of the
gods,' has long since pocketed his last sixpence; and vanished, six-pences
and all, like a ghost at cockcrowing." Yet, Carlyle goes on to
say, thanks to this book of Boswell's, "they who are gone are still
here; though hidden they are revealed, though dead they yet speak."</p>

purported to be fragments of Gaelic verse with translations. These
were so interesting that he was sent to the Highlands to hunt for more,
and within three years he published the <i class="pub">Poems of Ossian</i>, consisting
of two epics, "Fingal" and "Temora." Their genuineness has been
discussed ever since. Evidently Johnson settled the matter to his own
satisfaction and to Macaulay's, and you may be interested in what Boswell
has to say. At the same time it seems clear that Johnson went
too far in his charge of forgery. Macpherson probably did not find a
complete epic, yet he undoubtedly found some Gaelic poetry.</p>

<p>What would you have me retract? I thought your book an imposture; I
think it an imposture still. For this opinion I have given my reasons to the
publick, which I here dare you to refute. Your rage I defy. Your abilities,

and dramatist, altered and adapted some of Shakspere's plays. Both
Johnson and Boswell express their opinions of him frankly enough.
He was appointed poet laureate in 1730.</p>

<p><b>37</b> <span class="nsmall">25.</span> <b>Orrery.</b> Orrery did more than enjoy this privilege,&mdash;he
wrote a book entitled <i class="pub">Remarks on the Life and Writings of Jonathan

<p><b>38</b> <span class="nsmall">32.</span> <b>Malone.</b> Edmund Malone was a friend of Johnson, Burke,
and Reynolds. He wrote a supplement to Johnson's edition of Shakspere,
published an edition of Reynolds's works, and after bringing out
his own edition of Shakspere, left material for another edition, which
was published by James Boswell the younger in 1821. Boswell's
<i class="pub">Malone</i>, the "third variorum" edition, is generally considered the best.
To Boswell the elder, an intimate friend, he was of much assistance in
preparing the <i class="pub">Life of Johnson</i>, and he edited with valuable notes the

the music master from Brescia who, a little over three years after
Mr. Thrale's death, married the widow. After learning what you can
from Boswell, you will enjoy some such account as the <i class="pub">Encyclopædia
Britannica</i> offers. While doing your reading it may be well to keep
in mind what two or three critics have said. Mr. Mowbray Morris
writes: "After all the abuse showered on the unfortunate woman it is
pleasant to know that the marriage proved a happy one in every
respect. Piozzi, who was really a well-mannered, amiable man, took
every care of his wife's fortune, and on their return to England her
family and friends were soon reconciled to him." Mr. Leslie Stephen
says: "Her love of Piozzi, which was both warm and permanent, is
the most amiable feature of her character." Mr. Herbert Paul, after
praising Macaulay's <i class="pub">Life of Johnson</i>, adds, "Yet, if I may say so, I
can never forgive Macaulay for his cruel and unaccountable injustice
to Mrs. Thrale."</p>

<p><b>41</b> <span class="nsmall">3.</span> <b>the Ephesian matron.</b> She cared so much for her husband
that she went into the vault to die with him, and there, in the midst of

see Jeremy Taylor's <i class="pub">The Rule and Exercises of Holy Dying</i>, Chapter V,

The Right Hon. William Windham, a member of the Club, a friend of
Malone, Burke, Fox, and Pitt; in 1794 Secretary at War (Pitt's ministry),
in 1806 War and Colonial Secretary (Lord Grenville's ministry);
in the words of Macaulay, "the first gentleman of his age, the ingenious,
the chivalrous, the high-souled Windham." Johnson wrote him appreciative
letters in August and October, 1784. See Boswell.</p>

account of the "timid and obscure girl" who suddenly "found herself
on the highest pinnacle of fame," eulogized by such men as Burke,

<p>"That he was occasionally remarkable for violence of temper may
be granted: but let us ascertain the degree, and not let it be supposed
that he was in a perpetual rage, and never without a club in his hand
to knock down every one who approached him. On the contrary, the
truth is, that by much the greatest part of his time he was civil, obliging,
nay, polite in the true sense of the word; so much so, that many
gentlemen who were long acquainted with him never received, or even
heard a strong expression from him."</p>
